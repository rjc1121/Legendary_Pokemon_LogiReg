This project explores how well Pokémon from different generations can be used to predict legendary status using base stats. 

Using Julia, I cleaned and processed the dataset, assigned generations, and filtered legendaries versus non-legendaries. 
Logistic regression models were trained for each generation to classify legendary Pokémon, and accuracy was evaluated against all legendaries.
