#0001,Bulbasaur,Grass, Poison,Overgrow,,Chlorophyll,Monster, Grass,False,"Bulbasaur is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Ivysaur starting at level 16, which evolves into Venusaur starting at level 32. Along with Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is one of the three first partner Pokémon of Kanto available at the beginning of Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen. Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within. First partner Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokémon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokémon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a ""Bulba-by"". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. Bulbasaur can survive for days without even eating a single morsel. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots. It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.",45,49,49,65,65,45
#0002,Ivysaur,Grass, Poison,Overgrow,,Chlorophyll,Monster, Grass,False,"Ivysaur is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Bulbasaur starting at level 16 and evolves into Venusaur starting at level 32. Ivysaur is a quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process. Ivysaur are typically found in plains. Ivysaur evolves from Bulbasaur and evolves into Venusaur.",60,62,63,80,80,60
#0003,Venusaur,Grass, Poison,Overgrow,,Chlorophyll,Monster, Grass,False,"Venusaur is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Ivysaur starting at level 32. It is the final form of Bulbasaur. Venusaur has two forms: Mega Venusaur and Gigantamax Venusaur. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur using the Venusaurite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Venusaur if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Venusaur was introduced in The Isle of Armor. Venusaur is the game mascot of Pokémon Green and its remake Pokémon LeafGreen, appearing on the box art of both games. Venusaur is a squat, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes and a short, blunt snout. Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a gynoecium in the center of its flower. Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. In the anime, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands.",80,82,83,100,100,80
#0004,Charmander,Fire,,Blaze,,Solar Power,Monster, Dragon,False,"Charmander is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.

It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps. Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pokémon Snap and New Pokémon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food, and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.",39,52,43,60,50,65

#0006,Charizard,Fire, Flying,Blaze,,Solar Power,Monster, Dragon,False,"Charizard is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander. Charizard has three forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X using the Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using the Charizardite Y, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Charizard if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Charizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and its remake Pokémon FireRed, appearing on the boxart of both games. Along with Pikachu, Talonflame, and Decidueye, Charizard is one of the four partner Pokémon available through the Unite Licenses in Pokémon UNITE as of version 1.12.1.2. Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated. Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath is capable of melting boulders and massive glaciers, and has been known to accidentally cause forest fires. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. Charizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. The Pokémon the Series episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet . Charizard lives in herds with Charmander. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charizard is known to sleep in a incredibly relaxed position. This is because Charizard is very confident in its own power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong. Even though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the original Carddass Trading Cards of the year 1997. Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pokémon the Series. Eventually, in Pokémon Yellow, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokémon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola, Charizard is a Ride Pokémon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries. Charizard Glide",78,84,78,109,85,100

It has large, purplish or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves. Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. In the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, Squirtle are shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell. It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also on occasion, rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. In Generation II, Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.",44,48,65,50,64,43
#0008,Wartortle,Water,,Torrent,,Rain Dish,Monster, Water 1,False,"Wartortle is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Squirtle starting at level 16 and evolves into Blastoise starting at level 36. Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pokémon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity and good luck, making this Pokémon popular with the elderly. Because they are larger than Squirtle and have a larger shell, Wartortle have a more difficult time walking on land and keeping their balance in the water. To maintain balance while swimming at high speeds, Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands, but its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats. It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger. In Generation II, Wartortle and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Wartortle evolves from Squirtle and evolves into Blastoise.",59,63,80,65,80,58

It can Mega Evolve into Mega Blastoise using the Blastoisinite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Blastoise if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Blastoise was introduced in The Isle of Armor. Blastoise is the game mascot of the Japanese and international versions of Pokémon Blue, appearing on the boxart of both games. Blastoise is a large, bipedal turtle Pokémon. Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail. The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back are capable of producing water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and can be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise deliberately makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and to crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep. In Generation II, Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.",79,83,100,85,105,78
#0010,Caterpie,Bug,,Shield,,Run Away,Bug,,False,"Caterpie is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Metapod starting at level 7, which evolves into Butterfree starting at level 10. Caterpie is an insect Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. There are yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body, which resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort. Caterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grows and develops over time, it will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk. It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon. It has a voracious appetite, which drives it to eat a hundred leaves a day. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot. On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva.",45,30,35,20,20,45

The front of Metapod's shell resembles a face with heavy-lidded eyes and a sharply pointed nose. The back of its shell consists of several geometrically shaped portions and projections. Metapod's soft body is protected by a hard outer shell as it undergoes metamorphosis. While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it is unable to do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles, often in groups. Pikipek is a natural predator of Metapod. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Metapod is known to sleep while using the move Harden constantly to protect its innards. It stays still while sleeping to avoid getting attacked by foes.

#0012,Butterfree,Bug, Flying,Compound,,Tinted Lens,Bug,,False,"Butterfree is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Metapod starting at level 10. It is the final form of Caterpie. Butterfree can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Butterfree if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Butterfree is a lepidopteran insect Pokémon which resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male. The wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. It will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon using this powder. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Sappy Ending. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping. Butterfree has a Gigantamax Form. As Gigantamax Butterfree, its wings become shades of bright and dark green with a white pattern on them. At the base of the wings are a fur-like circle, which attaches to Gigantamax Butterfree's back. Its antennae become bright green as well, and extend to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround them. Its eyes glow bright red. Several green scales, created from crystallized Gigantamax energy, can be seen floating around Gigantamax Butterfree. These are its most effective weapons, capable of causing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. Gigantamax Butterfree scatters these scales by the winds that it generates with each flap of its wings; these winds are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck. Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle. Butterfree evolves from Metapod and is the final form of Caterpie.",60,45,50,80,80,70

Beedrill's head is round with a slightly pointed mouth; large, red eyes; and black antennae with a sharp bend in the middle. Its forelegs are tipped with long, conical stingers. It stands on its other two legs, which are long, segmented, and insectoid in shape. Beedrill has two pairs of rounded, veined wings and another stinger on its yellow-and-black striped abdomen. The abdominal stinger contains Beedrill's most potent poison. Beedrill is highly territorial and unlike real bees, Beedrill live in colonies rather than true ""hives"", and they work together to solve basic problems regarding food, territory, and reproduction . As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Challenge of the Samurai, Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of Weedle and Kakuna, and it will respond aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole colony to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. It is known to collect pollen, which Teddiursa combines with fruits to concoct honey. Beedrill have been seen living in hives and producing honey. Prior to Generation V, Twineedle was its signature move. Beedrill can Mega Evolve into Mega Beedrill. As Mega Beedrill, it gains more defined features. The antennae are shorter and T-shaped. Its eyes become longer and sleeker. It now has three pairs of wings; the uppermost pair is larger with black trim along the top. Its stingers become longer and larger, resembling lances. Additional conical, black-and-yellow stingers with white tips take the place of its legs. Its abdomen becomes larger, grooved, and is attached to its thorax by a black structure. A similar black structure connects its head and thorax. The stinger on its abdomen is now a pale yellow, and it now has black stripes over its entire body. Fast-acting poison is stored in the stingers on its limbs, while the tail stinger produces a slow-acting poison that is used to finish opponents. The instantaneous poisons are instead used to prevent the foe from fleeing. Beedrill evolves from Kakuna and is the final form of Weedle.",65,80,40,45,80,75

Pidgeot typically dwells in temperate forests with thick growth and large trees. It is known to prey on Magikarp, which it can spot from great heights. In Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Pidgeot can Mega Evolve into Mega Pidgeot. Pidgeot grows noticeably when it Mega Evolves, developing a larger body and longer, broader wings. Its wingtips and tail feathers are tipped with cyan, and its cream coloring is now white. Its eyes turn magenta and its pupils turn white. Mega Pidgeot has an even more elaborate crest on its head, with a streamer-like magenta plume extending from a mane of yellow feathers. A magenta feather projects from the front of its crest and there is a single magenta highlight on the left side. The crest is sensitive to air currents, acting like a large antenna and stabilizing Mega Pidgeot's flight. Additionally, its increased wing power allows it to fly for two weeks without rest.

Ekans lives in grassy savannas and plains, where it moves stealthily through grass. It can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands, where it preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests, but will strike other prey from behind. By flicking its tongue out, it is able to detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause it to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. In the second movie, it is revealed to possess some swimming abilities. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Ekans are known to sleep with its body all coiled up. It is believed that Ekans does this as a way to terrify foes, no matter which direction the foe is.

It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a matter of a few weeks. It also has the ability to detect vibrations as shown in the Pokémon the Series episode The Whistle Stop. In the Pokémon the Series episode The Misty Mermaid, it is shown that Arbok is capable of spending long periods underwater and surviving in aquatic environments. One particular Arbok could change its pattern at any time to increase power to different stats and get invulnerability to status conditions, if the pattern is uncovered. Arbok is territorial. It lashes out at intruders with long fangs tipped with deadly venom. Vengeful in nature, it will not give up a chase once it targets its prey or an opponent, no matter how far. It makes its home in grassy savannas and plains, but it can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands alongside its pre-evolved form Ekans. In the wild, it hunts smaller Pokémon such as Wooper, and also preys on Pidgey and Spearow Eggs. When hunting, it uses the pattern on its hood to immobilize prey, then it begins constricting them, and it finally poisons the target to finish them off and eat them.

It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped. In the Pokémon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye, wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu!, it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pokémon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter. Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pokémon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle.

Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark. Raichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up and its muscles become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To keep from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pokémon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu. As revealed in the Pokémon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown, Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping.

The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it can ride it like a surfboard and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities. Alolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes, especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe. However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general. It is also believed the weather and climate of the Alola region played a role in the transformation. Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts. It is also known by the name hodad. Alolan Raichu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Stoked Sparksurfer.

It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pokémon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents, but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body.",50,75,85,20,30,40

Sandslash can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly. Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. It also climbs trees to rest during the night, and to slash Berries to feed the Sandshrew waiting below. Sandslash can mostly be found in deserts. Sandslash has a regional form: Alolan Sandslash. In the Alola region, Sandslash has an icy blue hide and steel quills covered in ice. These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles. Unlike its Kantonian variant, Alolan Sandslash is rarely seen curling up into a ball, perhaps made difficult by its thick hide and icy spine. Instead, this Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while leaving only its spines exposed. Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs without even slipping. Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash can move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws. It can move faster than any other Pokémon while in the snowy mountains. This Pokémon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden. However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers. People also climb up the mountains it lives in, to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn. Stabs from Alolan Sandslash's spikes can cause both deep wounds and severe frostbite. They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.

Clefable is a timid, nocturnal creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the world's rarest Pokémon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from half a mile to 1,100 yards away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, mountainous areas of which it is protective. It has also been seen at deserted lakes during a full moon. Using a bouncy gait, it can walk on water and sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. In the Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy Tales, Clefable is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pokémon. According to one tradition, seeing a pair of Clefable ensures a happy marriage. Some scientists believe that Clefable stares intently at the moon because it is homesick. There is a legend to this as well, which tells of how it listens for the voices of its kind on the moon during clear and quiet nights. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Clefable is known to sleep in remote places during quiet, moonlit nights. It is theorized that Clefable is dreaming about its friends and distant homeland during its peaceful slumber. Before Generation V, Clefable and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability.

However, Vulpix is born with only a single, white tail that splits as Vulpix grows. The tails grow hot as it approaches evolution. Vulpix is capable of manipulating fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix performs this even when sleeping, as mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex. Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix can be found most commonly in grassy plains. Vulpix has a regional form: Alolan Vulpix. In the Alola region, Vulpix has adapted to snowy mountain peaks and developed a snowy white pelt. It has pale blue paws, blue eyes, and dark blue insides its ears. Its snout is more pronounced and pointed than that of non-Alolan Vulpix. The locks of hair on its head and its six tails are curlier and have a wispy appearance.

While intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a very vengeful Pokémon that has been known to curse those who mistreat it. Ninetails will also curse anyone who wakes it up by grabbing one of its many tails. The curse can last up to 1,000 years. As mentioned in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Ninetales is known to sleep while wrapped inside its tails, giving it a mystical appearance. In the first Pokémon movie, it's shown that it can swim. Pokémon-Amie shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grasslands. Ninetales has a regional form: Alolan Ninetales. In the Alola region, Ninetales have a different appearance. Its coat is pale blue, and its fur is more flowing and wispier. The tips of its tails and crest, as well as the lower halves of its legs, are white. The crest on its head is longer and its nine tails are less distinct from each other.

It has pointed ears with black insides and large, blue eyes. It has small, stubby arms and slightly longer feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. Its body is filled with air and, as seen in Pokémon Stadium, Jigglypuff can deflate until it is flat. It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros. Jigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pokémon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and in some areas, it sounds like shouting. Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows. Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Jigglypuff is known to sing even when sleeping.

It has long, rabbit-like ears with black insides and a slightly lighter color at the tips. Its large, blue eyes are covered in a layer of tears that quickly washes away any debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other Wigglytuff, will not want to stop. As a result, Wigglytuff is a highly sought-after Pokémon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur. Its body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. Wigglytuff can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate in total. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other Wigglytuff to see which one can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, Wigglytuff will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Wigglytuff is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in vivid green plains and grassy fields.

It has beady red eyes and a small mouth, and its head and torso are a single joined segment. On its head is a massive red flower with five bulky petals and an orange-brown center. Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pokémon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. When defeated in the side series games, Vileplume's body appears to either deflate or withers while the flower remains. Vileplume can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it. The larger the Vileplume's petals are, the more potent the toxin on its pollen is. Vileplume's behavior of flapping its petals also makes very loud noises. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Vileplume is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains.

Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pokémon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life. Prior to Generation III, Spore was its signature move. The anime has shown that Paras can often be found in caves. However, it can also thrive in damp forests.

Diglett is a tiny, brown Pokémon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible. Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground-type. It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown.

Diglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by Onix. It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Diglett is known to sleep underground during the night. Seeing a Diglett asleep above ground is considered to be good luck. In Generation II, Fissure was its signature move. Diglett has a regional form: Alolan Diglett. In Alola, Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to see outside. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness. Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. However, they are still very small, tying with Klefki and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type.

Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60 mph to a depth of 60 miles , triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the anime, Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, the three triplets of Dugtrio is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping. In Generation II, Fissure was its signature move. Dugtrio has a regional form: Alolan Dugtrio. Alolan Dugtrio is visually very similar to its counterpart, except each head has a mop of golden hair formed from modified whiskers.

Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet. Golduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pokémon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away.

It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas in the anime.

Primeape is a bipedal, simian Pokémon with a round body covered in light beige, shaggy fur. There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes. Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Poké Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new. In the anime, it has shown some fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains. It competes with Ursaring when it comes to searching for berries. In Paldea, Hawlucha is Primeape's natural enemy. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is very rare to find a Primeape sleeping without rage, possibly from exhausting itself.

In Hisui, Growlithe has a dual-type Fire/Rock regional form. It evolves into Hisuian Arcanine when exposed to a Fire Stone. Growlithe is a quadrupedal canine Pokémon. It has orange fur with black stripes along its back and legs. The fur on its muzzle, chest, belly, and tail is beige, as is an additional tuft of fur on top of its head. Growlithe's coat is noticeably longer on its chest and tail. It has gray eyes, a black nose, and large, round and triangular ears with beige interiors. Its forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each. Each paw has a brown pad. Growlithe is a friendly and loyal Pokémon that will fearlessly defend its Trainer and territory from harm, even against larger, stronger enemies. In particular, it has been known to fight with Rockruff over territory. It will fiercely bark at, bite, and chase away any perceived threat. Otherwise, this obedient Pokémon will wait motionlessly until given an order. It has a long history with people, as its bones have been found in Stone Age ruins. In the wild, Growlithe can be commonly found in grassy plains. Growlithe also has a powerful olfactory sense. If it detects an unknown smell in its territory, it roars to flush out the intruder. It can smell the emotions of others, and never forgets a scent. However, strong, unpleasant smells can disable Growlithe's sense of smell for short periods, as seen in the anime. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Growlithe is known to bark at anyone who approaches it while sleeping. Growlithe has a regional form: Hisuian Growlithe. In Hisui, Growlithe's fur is dark orange-red, while its mane and tail are light gray, and its muzzle is a light tan. The fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its mane covers its eyes and extends below its head, ending with three curls. Its ears are round and square with light orange-red interiors. It has a small horn made of rock on its head, and its tail is curly. Growlithe's Hisuian form is the result of it being exposed to volcanic activity within the coastal highlands it lives in during Hisui's early times. Hisuian Growlithe's soft and insulated fur allows it to survive the cold weather of Hisui. Although Hisuian Growlithe's horn is made of rock, it is fragile and breaks easily, so the Pokémon rarely uses its horn unless needed. Hisuian Growlithe live in pairs, and are known to be vigilant when guarding their territory. Hisuian Growlithe take much longer to bond with humans because they have lived apart from humans for a long time. Growlithe evolves into Arcanine.

Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad. Arcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokémon. It is capable of running 6,200 miles in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. In Generation II, Extreme Speed was its signature move. Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Arcanine is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in prairies, and Pokémon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the anime, it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Arcanine is known to sleep at supremely comfortable sleeping spot. Arcanine when it sleeps is said to be similar to how an innocent child sleeps. Arcanine has a regional form: Hisuian Arcanine. In Hisui, Arcanine has a different look due to the volcanic activity of the environment it lives in. Its body fur is red-orange while its muzzle, mane, tail, eyebrows, and tufts of fur behind its elbows and around its ankles are gray, and the insides of its ears are light gray. The gray fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its cheek mane, ankle fur, and tail form into curls. Its elbow fur resemble wings. It has a large horn in the center of its head and three small horns between its head and ears. Its mane form into curled clumps at the back of its neck and large rectangular clumps on the sides and bottom of its neck. The rectangular clumps have light red-orange markings on them.

There is a single green leaf on each side of its body. It has a yellow bell-shaped head with what appear to be pink lips at the end and beady black eyes. It is capable of spitting corrosive acid from its mouth. Its stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey. Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such. It will plant its roots in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted. Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, thus it lives in temperate forests and jungles. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Bellsprout is known to sleep while planting its roots deep in the ground.Because Bellsprout feels so safe while sleeping, it tends to forget that it may need to run from danger.

Victreebel also produces a sweet scent to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey animals becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey. It can be found in small groups and is territorial. In the manga, Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become more Victreebel. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles.

It is ecologically similar to Toedscool; however, the two are separate species. Tentacool is a small, cnidarian Pokémon. It has a light blue, clear body with two large, transparent, red, eye-like crystals on each side of its body and one small one in the middle. Near the base of its body is a pointed, beak-like projection and two eyes with small pupils. There are two grayish tentacles extending from beneath its round lower body, which has a cape-like formation on the back. Tentacool's entire body is made of 99% water, and the remaining 1% contains the organ that produces its poison. It absorbs sunlight and refracts it using the water inside its body to convert it into beam energy. Its tentacles are laced with stinging cells and, as seen in the anime, it can control Pokémon it touches with its tentacles. The tentacles break off occasionally, but they can regenerate. The poison from its tentacles is so potent, that someone would need to be immediately rushed to the hospital. Tentacool is not a very strong swimmer, traveling throughout the world using ocean currents. Tentacool searches for food while drifting on the surface of shallow seas. Tentacool can blend in the water, making it very difficult to spot. It will sometimes wash ashore and shrivel up due to dehydration, though it remains equally as dangerous. Tentacool may be revived if thrown back into the sea. Tentacool is mistakenly believed to be a species relative of Toedscool; in actuality, the two Pokémon are biologically unrelated.

Extending from its lower body are two blue, beak-like appendages and numerous grayish tentacles. Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, communicating with its own kind, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves. Tentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey in a net-like shape before immobilizing it with poison. The tentacles can grow or shrink with ease. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages.

In Galar, Ponyta has a Psychic-type regional form. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at level 40. Ponyta is an equine Pokémon with cream-colored fur. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames make up its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers. Ponyta are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day. In the anime, it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them, and Ponyta only does this for those that it has accepted. Ponyta herds tend to live in grasslands, plains, mountains, or anywhere that they can run freely. Ponyta has a regional form: Galarian Ponyta. Ponyta has adapted in the forests of the Galar region, after generations of being exposed to the life energy found within. Galarian Ponyta has chalk-white fur covering most of its body. Instead of flames, its mane, tail and fetlocks are covered in a long, purple-and-blue, fluffy fur. Its eyes are purple with light-blue irises, and it has a small purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead. Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use. Galarian Ponyta's horn has healing powers; it can heal any slight wound with a few rubs from its horn. By looking into the eyes of a person, Galarian Ponyta can read the contents of their heart. Should it find any evil, it will promptly go into hiding. As shown in the anime, Galarian Ponyta can send pleas for help in the form of visions to people, even if they're from another region.

Yellow and reddish-orange flames stream from the back of its head to form a long, flowing mane. A short version of the mane trails down its back to its equally fiery tail. Flames are also present on its fetlocks. It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof. Rapidash is a very agile Pokémon. It runs at about 150 mph , chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature that is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash is capable of traveling an entire region like Hisui within a day and a half. Rapidash lives in grasslands, but it can also be seen on mountains in Pokémon Snap. Rapidash has a regional form: Galarian Rapidash. In Galar, Rapidash takes on a new form with a white coat, pale blue eyes, and a long, curly mane and tail colored in streaks of pastel cyan and pink. Its horn is much longer than that of Kantonian Rapidash and is deep violet in color with a spiraling white line running its length. Its fetlocks are adorned with long pink fur that stores psychic energy, which gives it a swift, airy gait, and it has deep violet hooves. When using psychic energy, its horn glows with a yellow aura, and its colored fur glows with seemly flowing color. Galarian Rapidash lives in forests and is known for being brave and prideful. It can channel its psychic power into a powerful Psycho Cut from its horn that can pierce through sheet metal.

It is one of Slowpoke's final forms, the other being Slowking. Slowbro can Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro using the Slowbronite. In Galar, Slowbro has a dual-type Poison/Psychic regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield's 1.2.0 patch. It evolves from Galarian Slowpoke when exposed to a Galarica Cuff. It is one of Galarian Slowpoke's final forms, the other being Galarian Slowking. These Slowbro can also be found in Blueberry Academy's Terarium. Slowbro is a bipedal, pink Pokémon with a tan, striped belly and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke. Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Slowbro usually sleeps at the same time Shellder bites its tail. On occasion, Slowbro sleeps even when Shellder is still awake. Slowbro has a regional form, Galarian Slowbro, and can Mega Evolve into Mega Slowbro. In Galar, Slowbro's appearance differs due to Shellder biting its arm instead of its tail, causing a chemical reaction between the Shellder's poison and the consumed Galarica spices within the Slowpoke's body. The Shellder attached to its arm resembles the Shellder tail of its Kantonian counterpart, but is smaller, with a purple tip shaped like a stinger, and lacking visible pupils. Galarian Slowbro itself has a slight color difference compared to its counterpart, being pinker, with purple accents on its head, arms, and tail. Galarian Slowbro is considered highly dangerous for its tendency to indiscriminately attack its surroundings, the reason for which is due to its Shellder sometimes unconsciously biting down hard on its arm. Another reason is that Shellder feels bliss when biting hard enough to absorb Galarian Slowbro's poison. However, Shellder will occasionally faint from the seeping poison, and Galarian Slowbro occasionally lashes out due to the itching caused by said poison. While normally zoned out, when facing a strong opponent its body becomes stimulated, and it will sport a sharper expression. Galarian Slowbro attacks by grabbing at its Shellder's tongue, causing the Shellder to fire poisonous liquids from its tip. It attacks at speeds rivaling the quickest of known reflexes. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Galar's regional life is simulated. Galarian Slowbro is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Side Arm. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Quick Draw as an Ability. As Mega Slowbro, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible. Its head pokes out of the Shellder's mouth and is surrounded by the Shellder's enlarged teeth. The Shellder has holes on its sides and an opening at its tip, allowing Mega Slowbro's arms and tail to stick out. Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed. It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring. The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spare dots are only visible on its middle section. Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness. This allows it to act as armor so hard that nothing can scratch it. The Slowbro inside is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids. Slowbro evolves from Slowpoke and is one of its final forms, the other being Slowking. Galarian Slowbro evolves from Galarian Slowpoke.

In Galar, Farfetch'd has a Fighting-type regional form. Galarian Farfetch'd evolves into Sirfetch'd after landing three critical hits in a single battle. Kantonian Farfetch'd is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Farfetch'd is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead , and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail. Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as the anime and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the anime, Farfetch’d are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks. Farfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pokémon capable of using the Leek item. Farfetch'd has a regional form: Galarian Farfetch'd. In Galar, Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head and a much more unfriendly look on its face. The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the Large Leek used as a curry ingredient is unknown. Galarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek. However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly. It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins. As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into Sirfetch'd. Galarian Farfetch'd evolves into Sirfetch'd.

#0084,Doduo,Normal, Flying,Run, Early,Tangled Feet,Flying,,False,"Doduo is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Dodrio starting at level 31. Doduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokémon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes. It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync. Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph , it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs. Doduo evolves into Dodrio.",35,85,45,35,35,75
#0085,Dodrio,Normal, Flying,Run, Early,Tangled Feet,Flying,,False,"Dodrio is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Doduo starting at level 31. Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking. Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up. Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off. Dodrio evolves from Doduo.",60,110,70,60,60,100
#0086,Seel,Water,,Thick, Hydration,Ice Body,Water 1, Field,False,"Seel is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Dewgong starting at level 34. Seel is a pinniped Pokémon with a thick hide covered in bluish-white fur. It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout. Seel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40° Fahrenheit . It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land. Seel evolves into Dewgong.",65,45,55,45,70,45
#0087,Dewgong,Water, Ice,Thick, Hydration,Ice Body,Water 1, Field,False,"Dewgong is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Seel starting at level 34. Dewgong is a pinniped Pokémon with a snowy white, furry body. Its fur renders it virtually invisible in snowy conditions. Its face has two black eyes, a black nose, and two tusks extending from its upper jaw. It has a streamlined body with two front flippers and a long flowing tail. Even in extremely cold and ice-packed waters, its tail allows it to be a swift and agile swimmer at speeds of 8 knots. On top of its head is a sharp horn, which allows it to cut through the thickest ice floes. It lives on icebergs adrift in frigid ocean waters. It thrives in lower temperatures, becoming increasingly more active the colder the weather. By storing thermal energy within its body, it is completely unharmed by even the most intense freezing weather. During daylight hours, it sleeps on bitterly cold ice or under shallow water. However, at night when the temperature drops, it becomes a hunter and searches for prey such as Wishiwashi. Following a meal, it sunbathes on the beach. This raises its body temperature and aids in digestion. Dewgong evolves from Seel.",90,70,80,70,95,70
#0088,Grimer,Poison,,Stench, Sticky,Poison Touch,Amorphous,,False,"Grimer is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Muk starting at level 38. In Alola, Grimer has a dual-type Poison/Dark regional form. It evolves into Alolan Muk starting at level 38. These Grimer can also be found in Blueberry Academy's Terarium. Grimer is a slimy, amorphous Pokémon, born from sludge in dirty streams or seabeds that are exposed to lunar radiation. It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds. Due to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction. Prior to Generation IV, Grimer and its evolved form, Muk, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stench as an Ability. Grimer has a regional form: Alolan Grimer. Grimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population. Alolan Grimer eats solid garbage instead of sludge; this new diet has caused its body composition and form to change. Alolan Grimer's body is green with a line of yellow sludge along its lower lip that extends around behind its head, a bright blue tongue, and small black crescent-shaped spaces behind its eyes. It also has two blunt ""teeth"" in its upper jaw, which are actually crystallized toxins formed by its diet. It is not known how to break down these toxic crystals, but direct contact with them is known to be dangerous. Lethal poisons leak out of Alolan Grimer's body when these crystals fall out. Because it produces and stores toxins within its body, Alolan Grimer does not produce a foul stench like Kantonian Grimer. There are usually about one hundred Alolan Grimer found living near waste-disposal sites in Alola, assisting people in dealing with garbage. Alolan Grimer is widely used and a very popular Pokémon used in garbage disposal facilities around the world. Alolan Grimer is perpetually hungry and must constantly eat trash. If no trash is readily available, it will eat other manufactured products instead. In addition to garbage, Alolan Grimer preys on Trubbish and Garbodor; its introduction to Alola caused their populations to decrease in the region. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated. Alolan Grimer and its evolved form, Alolan Muk, are the only known Pokémon that can have Power of Alchemy as an Ability. Grimer evolves into Muk. Alolan Grimer evolves into Alolan Muk.",80,80,50,40,50,25
#0089,Muk,Poison,,Stench, Sticky,Poison Touch,Amorphous,,False,"Muk is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Grimer starting at level 38. In Alola, Muk has a dual-type Poison/Dark regional form. It evolves from Alolan Grimer starting at level 38. These Muk can also be found in Blueberry Academy's Terarium. Muk is a large, sticky, amorphous Pokémon made of living purple sludge. It has two small eyes with beady black pupils. It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws. While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand. However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand. Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike. Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting. However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing. Muk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities, where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction. Prior to Generation IV, Muk and its pre-evolved form, Grimer, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stench as an Ability. Muk has a regional form: Alolan Muk. Alolan Muk has a more vibrant coloration, consisting of green, pink, and yellow stripes with thin blue bands in between. The green, yellow, and pink stripes are capable of shifting downwards while the blue stays in place. It has various white, crystallized poison shards protruding from parts of its body, especially from its mouth and fingers, giving the impression of claws and fangs. It has blue eyes with a black space behind them and a bright blue tongue. Its vivid coloration is a result of the garbage it eats, which causes chemical changes in its body. Its body contains over a hundred different kinds of poisons. Chemical reactions of different poisons occurring within its body is the source of Alolan Muk's vitality. Alolan Muk is unexpectedly quiet and friendly. However, if it is not fed trash for a while, its hunger will compel it to destroy its Trainer's furnishings for food. It is thought that it cannot maintain its energy without a constant source of toxins, which causes its voracious appetite. The crystals covering its body have a tendency to break off, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with due to the concentrated toxins contained within them. Unlike Kantonian Muk, Alolan Muk does not produce a foul stench due to its toxins being contained within its body. Alolan Muk preys on Trubbish and Garbodor. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.

#0090,Shellder,Water,,Shell, Skill,Overcoat,Water 3,,False,"Shellder is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Cloyster when exposed to a Water Stone. Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell. While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its hoist. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder. Prior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pokémon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.

#0091,Cloyster,Water, Ice,Shell, Skill,Overcoat,Water 3,,False,"Cloyster is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Shellder when exposed to a Water Stone. Cloyster is a black bivalve mollusk Pokémon. It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing. It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike. Cloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone, Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails. Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder, are relatives of Gastrodon. Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster. In Generation I, Clamp was its signature move. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder, were the only known Pokémon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.

Drowzee is a bipedal Pokémon that resembles a tapir. It has tired-looking eyes, a short trunk above its mouth, and triangular ears with brown interiors. The upper half of Drowzee's body is yellow and the lower half is brown. A wavy line separates the two halves. It has a round belly and short legs. Its feet are brown, except for its two toes, which are yellow. The bottom of each foot has a small, round, pink pad in the middle of it. There are three fingers on each of its hands. Drowzee is believed to have a common ancestor with Munna and Musharna. Drowzee is able to put people to sleep and can then sense the person's dreams. This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating. It has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams. It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier. Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten and may show past meals to a person it trusts. It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep. Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas.

On its neck, it has a ruff of white fur, which is longer on the female. Hypno has five fingers on each hand and holds a pendulum in its left. The pendulum resembles a flat, silver ring and is used for hypnotism. Hypno is never seen without it. It has three toes on each foot, which also have a pink pad on the undersides. Hypno is able to put people to sleep by swinging its pendulum. It is known to reside away from humans and on less-traveled roads. While it awaits its prey, it polishes its pendulum. If anyone comes by, Hypno will hypnotize them and eat their dreams. It carries away people having good dreams and is even known to have stolen a child at one point. However, in the Alola region, it preys primarily on Komala, and cases of Hypno targeting humans are notably rare. Some Hypno are even known to assist doctors in hospitals when their patients cannot sleep at night. In the Trainers' School in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, a Hypno is shown to be capable of creating illusions, namely by disguising itself as a human and causing illusory children to appear.

#0098,Krabby,Water,,Hyper, Shell,Sheer Force,Water 3,,False,"Krabby is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Kingler starting at level 28. Krabby is a crustacean Pokémon with a strong outer shell protecting its small body. Its upper half is red and has its eyes and two small spikes on the top of its head. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower body is light tan and doubles as its jaw with two fangs overlapping its upper body. Its hips are visible on the lower front of its body connected to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. The main features of Krabby's body are the two large, red pincers at the end of its arms. Krabby uses them as its main form of offense, and as a form of balance. Sometimes, Krabby may lose a claw during battle or have a damaged claw forcibly removed. However, the claw regenerates over a short period. In the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water. Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand. In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients and will be very aggressive in defending its home. Its main form of defense is creating foam to shroud its body, in order to confuse opponents into thinking that it is bigger than it actually is. As seen in the anime, Krabby generally keeps to itself, but will quickly defend itself if provoked. Prior to Generation III, Krabby and its evolved form, Kingler, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Crabhammer. Krabby evolves into Kingler.",30,105,90,25,25,50

Kingler can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Kingler if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Kingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel. Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. Prior to Generation III, Kingler and its pre-evolved form, Krabby, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Crabhammer. Kingler has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Kingler, it has gained a larger, spikier appearance. Three red clouds float around the crown spikes on its head and the white sclera of its eyes are bright red. It now has foaming bubbles around its mouth in the shape of a mustache and long beard. The left pincer of Kingler has become much larger and its arms and legs have become longer as a result of Gigantamaxing. There is white, striped armor similar to teeth inside the pincers. The arms and legs both have several spikes. Kingler's claw-like feet have become orange and straighter. The left pincer of Gigantamax Kingler can destroy anything it hits. The bubbles it releases are strongly alkaline. Should any opponent be struck by the bubbles, their bodies will quickly melt away.

#0100,Voltorb,Electric,,Soundproof, Static,Aftermath,Mineral,,False,"Voltorb is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Electrode starting at level 30. In Hisui, Voltorb has a dual-type Electric/Grass regional form. It evolves into Hisuian Electrode when exposed to a Leaf Stone. Voltorb is a spherical Pokémon that resembles a buttonless Poké Ball with eyes. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Poké Ball, Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result. Voltorb has a regional form: Hisuian Voltorb. Hisuian Voltorb, like its modern counterpart, resemble the Apricorn-made Poké Balls of the time period — both appear to be made of a grainy, woodlike substance, with a glossy surface and a hole on top. On the inside, Hisuian Voltorb's body contains numerous seeds, but it has been impossible to examine its interior due to it being pitch-black. Hisuian Voltorb has a distinctive red wooden unibrow. Despite its resemblance to a Poké Ball, it can be inferred that Hisuian Voltorb's existence predates the device's invention, as evidenced by the fact that the ancient hero of Hisui legend had an Electrode companion which would become the ancestor of the region's noble Electrode. Hisuian Voltorb can store electric currents in its belly, which it discharges all at once from its hole. Unlike Kantonian Voltorb, Hisuian Voltorb have friendly and excitable temperaments, which leads them to cluster around people, causing them to be a nuisance when they discharge. It is known to let out a great, uproarious laugh whenever it discharges. There are stories of people temporarily plugging the holes of Hisuian Voltorb to prevent them from discharging before removing them from their settlements. Voltorb evolves into Electrode.

#0101,Electrode,Electric,,Soundproof, Static,Aftermath,Mineral,,False,"Electrode is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Voltorb starting at level 30. In Hisui, Electrode has an Electric/Grass regional form. It evolves from Hisuian Voltorb when exposed to a Leaf Stone. Electrode is a round Pokémon resembling an upside-down Poké Ball with a mouth and eyes. Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. For this reason, many Trainers try to pick it up, mistaking it for an item. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Electrode as hollow. Many know it by the nickname ""Bomb Ball"", due to its unpredictable and explosive nature. Electrode tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind. Electrode has a regional form: Hisuian Electrode. In Hisui, Electrode also resembles an upside-down Poké Ball, specifically one of its time period, with a wooden upper half and a glossy, dark red lower half with a hole in the bottom. Its eyes are large black holes inside a debossed pattern, resembling an angry glare. Its mouth is in a constant frown, giving the impression that it is drawn on. Interestingly, its surface texture is similar to that of an Apricorn. When enraged, Hisuian Electrode can unleash an electric current equivalent to about twenty lightning bolts. It can absorb and store chlorophyll energy along with electricity. Electrode can release this energy through the hole on its lower half. It can also climb up trees. A special Hisuian Electrode is worshipped by the Hisui people due to it being descended from one of the ten ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from Arceus despite the fact that Poké Balls had not yet been invented. In particular, it is one of the Noble Pokémon who resides in Coronet Highlands, watched over by the Warden Melli. Hisuian Electrode is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Chloroblast.

#0102,Exeggcute,Grass, Psychic,Chlorophyll,,Harvest,Grass,,False,"Exeggcute is a dual-type Grass/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Exeggutor when exposed to a Leaf Stone. In Alola, Exeggcute will evolve into Alolan Exeggutor when exposed to a Leaf Stone. Exeggcute is a Pokémon resembling a group of six light pink ""eggs"", usually seen arranged with five heads huddled around a sixth. Each ""head"" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species. Exeggcute gather in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the anime. It needs six Exeggcute in order to stay balanced or else it becomes nervous and cowardly. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests. Exeggcute in the Alola region tend to be heavier than those from elsewhere. This is due to the shells being packed full. Exeggcute and its evolved form, Exeggutor, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Barrage. Exeggcute evolves into Exeggutor. In Alola, it evolves into Alolan Exeggutor.",60,40,80,60,45,40
#0103,Exeggutor,Grass, Psychic,Chlorophyll,,Harvest,Grass,,False,"Exeggutor is a dual-type Grass/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Exeggcute when exposed to a Leaf Stone. In Alola, Exeggutor has a dual-type Grass/Dragon regional form. It evolves from Exeggcute when exposed to a Leaf Stone. All Exeggcute in Alola evolve into this form regardless of their origin. These Exeggutor can also be found in Blueberry Academy's Terarium. Exeggutor is a tall, bipedal Pokémon that resembles a coconut tree or palm tree. Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions. Exeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute. In the anime, Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokémon. Exeggutor has been referred to as ""The Walking Tropical Rainforest"" or ""The Walking Jungle"". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles. Exeggutor and its pre-evolved form, Exeggcute, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Barrage. Exeggutor has a regional form: Alolan Exeggutor. Due to the abundance of sunlight in the Alola region, the Exeggutor that live there grow over five times taller than those in other regions. The region is considered to be the best environment for Alolan Exeggutor. Alolan Exeggutor's neck is thinner and much longer, causing it to more closely resemble a coconut tree or tropical palm tree than its Kantonian counterpart, which resembles the shorter desert palm. It has a long, tapering tail with two leaves and a fourth light green head on the tip. This extra head can also act on its own and defend the rear. The tail can use weak telepathy to scan the surrounding area. Its long neck can be used as a whip to attack enemies with its hard head. However, its neck can also be a weak point, as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened its draconic powers, resulting in its psychic powers becoming weaker. Ancient carvings and murals depict this Pokémon. Alolan Exeggutor is considered the pride of the Alola region by its natives. Alolans take pride in its appearance, claiming this is what Exeggutor ought to look like. Its extra height makes it the tallest and heaviest Grass-type. Alolan Exeggutor can be found on Exeggutor Island, a former trial site in Alola, which is not only shaped like an Exeggutor, but contains many wild Exeggutor, giving the island its name. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated. In Generation VII, Dragon Hammer was its signature move, but Tropius could still inherit it via breeding.",95,95,85,125,65,55

In Alola, Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak when leveled up at night starting at level 28. Cubone is a small, bipedal, dinosaur-like reptilian Pokémon with a light brown hide that covers most of its body, except for its cream-colored belly. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black eyes and a small area surrounding them. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. The small Cubone survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon. It is called the Lonely Pokémon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits ""a plaintive and mournful sound."" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, a natural predator. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes terms with its mother's death. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Cubone is known to cry while sleeping.It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pokémon were buried and mourned. Cubone and its evolved form, Marowak, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang. Cubone and Marowak are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III, Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves. Cubone evolves into Marowak.

In Alola, Marowak has a dual-type Fire/Ghost regional form. It evolves from Cubone when leveled up at night starting at level 28. All Cubone in Alola evolve into this form regardless of their origin. Marowak is a bipedal Pokémon with light brown skin and a cream-colored underside. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot makes up its toes. It has a short tail with a small spike near the tip. Marowak's head is composed of the skull it once wore as a mask. It can no longer remove the skull, which has become part of its body. The skull has two pointed spikes on the back similar to ears and tiny nostrils on the tip of the snout. Marowak's triangular, brown eyes are also located in the skull. Marowak is well known for its ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as sturdy as armor. Upon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz, which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace. On occasion, it is seen affectionately holding onto the bone while sleeping. Marowak and its pre-evolved form, Cubone, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang. Marowak and Cubone are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III, Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves. Marowak has a regional form: Alolan Marowak. In the Alola region, Marowak was faced with an abundance of its natural enemies, Grass-type Pokémon. This harsh environment led it to bond closely with its friends, which is said to have created a sort of sixth sense and caused it to take a new form. Alolan Marowak's body is black and it has pale gray eyes. There is a dark, flamelike mark on its skull between the eyes. Compared to regular Marowak's squatter, thicker body, Alolan Marowak is relatively thin. White markings resembling shoulder blades, vertebrae, and hip bones are visible on its back. The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dancing in mourning. Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame and then twirls the flaming bone. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone. The dance is also used as a way of mourning for its lost allies. Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. The flames are known to cause both mental and physical pain. Alolan Marowak is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shadow Bone. A special Alolan Marowak in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Wela Volcano Park's Island trial.

It evolves from Tyrogue starting at level 20 when Tyrogue's Attack is higher than its Defense. It is one of Tyrogue's final forms, the others being Hitmonchan and Hitmontop. Hitmonlee is a humanoid Pokémon with an ovoid body. Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart. Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring . The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the ""Kick Master"". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop. Hitmonlee has had several kicking moves as signature moves: Prior to Generation V, Reckless was Hitmonlee's signature Ability. Hitmonlee evolves from Tyrogue.",50,120,53,35,110,87

Hitmonchan is a tan, humanoid Pokémon that is exclusively male and has no female counterpart. There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area. As its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop. In Generation II, Mach Punch was its signature move, but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding. Prior to Generation V, Iron Fist was Hitmonchan's signature Ability. Hitmonchan evolves from Tyrogue.",50,105,79,35,110,76

In Galar, Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing starting at level 35. Koffing is a spherical Pokémon filled with toxic gases. It has vacant eyes and a wide mouth that usually has two pointed teeth in the upper jaw. However, a full set of teeth has been seen in the anime. Below its face is a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking. Several geyser-like protrusions, which usually release a mustard-colored gas, cover this Pokémon's body. Koffing's purple skin is very thin, and over-inflation can cause it to explode. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depicts Koffing as having a hollow body. Koffing creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around them. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing Koffing to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the anime, Koffing's gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. It feeds on the fumes of raw, rotting trash found in gas dumps and polluted air. Koffing at one point was plentiful in Galar due to factories. Koffing is most often found in urban areas. Koffing and its evolution, Weezing, are the only known Pokémon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability. Koffing evolves into Weezing. In Galar, it evolves into Galarian Weezing.",40,65,95,60,45,35
#0110,Weezing,Poison,,Levitate, Neutralizing,Stench,Amorphous,,False,"Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. In Galar, Weezing has a dual-type Poison/Fairy regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin. Weezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have different sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare. Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level. Weezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives. Weezing and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability. Weezing has a regional form: Galarian Weezing. In the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a gray body with the skull, crossbones, and ring patterns changed to the color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly releases purified air. Five puffs of green poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The gas clouds also partly cover its faces: the larger head has a mustache-like cloud on its upper lip, while the smaller head has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard. Galarian Weezing consumes particles from polluted air and expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Galarian Weezing's body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leak and drift around it. The gas is its best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff. Galarian Weezing preys on Trubbish for the fumes it produces. Galarian Weezing is also the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Strange Steam. Additionally, in Generation IX, Galarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon that can have Misty Surge as an Ability.",65,90,120,85,70,60

It has large, cream-colored ears, narrow, red eyes, and a short, rounded snout with two fangs in the back of its upper jaw. On top of its head is a thick, black plate. There are epaulette-like growths over its shoulders and a row of spikes down its back. It has three clawed digits on each hand and foot and a thick tail. On its belly is a pouch that contains a baby Kangaskhan. Unlike its parent, the baby is light purple and has smooth skin. Kangaskhan is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Kangaskhan is a nurturing Pokémon that protects its young at all costs. It can move really fast, even with the baby in its pouch. The baby leaves the pouch only rarely until it is three years old. In order to avoid crushing the baby, Kangaskhan sleeps standing up. If the mother feels the environment is safe, it will allow its young out to play. However, it will violently attack anything that it sees as a threat to its young. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Kangaskhan will defend the baby in its pouch, even while it sleeps. If the baby is awake but the parent wants to sleep, Kangaskhan will lie down to sleep while the baby sits on top of its back. They are known to raise other species of Pokémon alongside their own children, and records exist which describe a childless Kangaskhan raising a lost human child. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe. It uses quick jabs to intimidate its enemies. Although it was nearly hunted to extinction, Kangaskhan can be found in savannahs and other grasslands. Prior to Generation III, Dizzy Punch was its signature move. Kangaskhan can Mega Evolve into Mega Kangaskhan. As Mega Kangaskhan, the mother Kangaskhan appears unchanged. However, the baby temporarily grows and gains some new features. There are now raised patches on its knees similar to those seen on its mother. These patches also appear aligned horizontally along its waist with a larger patch on its belly. Small, spiked growths appear underneath its ears. The child is feisty, hates to lose, and will boldly challenge its opponents to protect its mother. The mother's happiness over its child's growth is the source of its additional strength. However, it feels uneasy about the child's future, as it is only skilled at fighting and nothing else. It is also saddened by the reminder that its child will one day leave. Mega Kangaskhan is the only known Pokémon that can have Parental Bond as an Ability.",105,95,80,40,80,90

Goldeen's billowing tail fin is orange around the base and turns white toward the edges. Its tail is admired by many for its beauty and similarity to a ballroom dress. Goldeen has a wild temperament and will use its horn to smash its way to freedom if kept in an aquarium. It competes with others of its kind to determine which has the strongest, thickest horn. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen rams them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of fresh water, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring. Its strong fins allow it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. It is known as the ""Water Dancer"" due to its elegant movements in the water. In Generation I, Waterfall was its signature move. Goldeen evolves into Seaking.",45,67,60,35,50,63

A female will have a smaller horn than a male. Most of its body is orange with a patch of white under its mouth and along its underside. There are several black markings on its body: two thick lines under each eye, a large wavy patch on its back, and several speckles near its tail. It has billowing pectoral fins and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white speckled with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid. Seaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance. Seaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other.

Staryu is a golden-brown, echinoderm Pokémon with five appendages. These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact. When the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. The anime has shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pokémon Snap. In Generation III, Camouflage was its signature move. In the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, and the original Japanese version of the anime episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic.

The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokémon Snap. From its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the anime, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be extraterrestrial. It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon. Starmie evolves from Staryu.",60,75,85,100,85,115

It evolves into Mr. Rime starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin. Kantonian Mr. Mime is not known to evolve into any other Pokémon. Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips. From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. In the TCG, Mr. Mime is shown to be adept at rock climbing. Mr. Mime is usually very rare but can be found in suburban areas. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is hard to tell whether Mr. Mime is either sleeping or pretending to be asleep due to its masterful pantomime skills. In Generation II, Substitute was its signature move. Prior to Generation VI and in Generation VIII, Mr. Mime and its pre-evolved form, Mime Jr., were the only known Pokémon that could have Filter as an Ability.

It has a suit-like body comprising a white top, blue shoulder spheres, blue bottom trousers, and a diamond-shaped crystal that resembles a tie. It has mitten-like hands and feet that are more defined, resembling blue shoes with light blue soles, presumably made out of ice. Through its feet, it is able to control the temperature and create a floor of ice, which it can kick up to act as a barrier. It is widely known in the region for its talent in tap dancing and is likely the result of Mr. Rime's influence over Mime Jr. imitating their dance steps. Galarian Mr. Mime and its evolved form, Mr. Rime, are the only known Pokémon that can have Screen Cleaner as an Ability.

#0124,Jynx,Ice, Psychic,Oblivious, Forewarn,Dry Skin,Human-Like,,False,"Jynx is a dual-type Ice/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Smoochum starting at level 30. Jynx is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon that resembles a woman. It has a purple face, pink lips, saucer-like eyes, and long blonde hair. It wears a red gown with two gold circlets on the chest. While the anime has shown it to possess feet, the games show only blackness under the dress and it lacks a footprint. Despite this, it is able to learn the kicking move Triple Axel. It has white arms and five-fingered purple hands. Jynx is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Originally, its face was colored black. Pokémon Stadium's fainting animation had it disappear leaving only its hair behind, implying that what appears to be dark-colored skin is actually just darkness. Jynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements. In certain parts of Galar, it has been feared and worshiped while being called the ""Queen of Ice"". The Jynx in Galar are said to have beautiful and delicate voices and a fanbase dedicated to them. Jynx are able to extend their lips to kiss its opponent. Jynx often is found in urban areas. Jynx is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Lovely Kiss by leveling up.",65,50,35,115,95,95

#0127,Pinsir,Bug,,Hyper, Mold,Moxie,Bug,,False,"Pinsir is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Pinsir can Mega Evolve into Mega Pinsir using the Pinsirite. Pinsir is a bipedal, coleopteran insectoid Pokémon with a wide, dull-brown body divided into segments by thin lines. On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward. Pinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir’s horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, the anime has shown that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Pokémon Sleep, Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks. Pinsir can Mega Evolve into Mega Pinsir. As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange venation near the base. Additionally, a set of brown elytra appear. Slicing through each elytron is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow. When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. It rarely touches the ground due to its ability to now fly. Mega Pinsir can travel up to approximately 30 mph and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them. Mega Pinsir can lift opponents up to 10 times heavier than itself with its horns and still fly around easily.",65,125,100,55,70,85
#0128,Tauros,Normal,,Intimidate, Anger,Sheer Force,Field,,False,"Tauros is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, but it is considered to be a counterpart of Miltank. In Paldea, Tauros has three different regional forms: Combat Breed, which is pure Fighting-type, Blaze Breed, which is dual-type Fighting/Fire, and Aqua Breed, which is dual-type Fighting/Water. Tauros is a quadrupedal, bovine Pokémon. It is covered in light brown fur with a thick, darker brown mane around the neck. It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns growing from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species. Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as Ride Pokémon, which is done to this day, originated in Alola. In contrast, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't like to be ridden. Tauros is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Raging Bull. In Paldea, Tauros has three separate regional forms: Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed. All three forms of Paldean Tauros are covered in dark gray fur, and have a thick black mane, gray horns, black hooves, and dark gray tails with black tips. Each form also has three gray bumps running vertically on its forehead, increasing in size from top to bottom. The physical differences between the three forms are visible on the shapes of their horns, manes, and tails. The three forms of Paldean Tauros are known as ""The Wild Bulls of Paldea"". The Combat Breed of Paldean Tauros has short, rounded, almost straight horns, and its mane and tails are shaped similarly to Kantonian Tauros. Combat Breed Paldean Tauros is known for its thick, powerful muscles and aggressive nature. Thanks to its muscular body, it is skilled at close-quarters combat, able to use its horns to strike at an opponent's weak spots. The Blaze Breed of Paldean Tauros has sharp horns, pointing forward and bent at right angles. Its mane is spiky with streaks of red, and its tails are intertwined. Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros earns its name from the hot air it breathes from its nostrils. When channeling its fire energy, the bumps and horns on Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow red. The horns can reach a temperature of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit , causing anyone gored by them to suffer both wounds and burns. The Aqua Breed of Paldean Tauros has horns that usually point upward but can rotate backward — each horn has two round, bulbous forms and a hole on its tip. Its mane flows downward and is shaped like a beard, with five teardrop-shaped blue accents on it. Its tails are usually straight, but can bend to form a propeller shape, which aids it in swimming. Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros is recognized for its high body fat, which allows it to float easily in the water. It swims by unleashing high-pressure jets of water from its horns, as well as using its tails to propel itself. It can use the same water jets to pierce right through any enemy it hits. The bumps and horns on Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow light blue when it attacks. Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros's horns glowing as it attacks Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros's horns glowing as it unleashes water from them",75,100,95,40,70,110
#0129,Magikarp,Water,,Swift,,Rattled,Water 2, Dragon,False,"Magikarp is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Gyarados starting at level 20. Magikarp is a piscine Pokémon with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp. In Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes. Magikarp evolves into Gyarados.",20,10,55,15,20,80
#0130,Gyarados,Water, Flying,Intimidate,,Moxie,Water 2, Dragon,False,"Gyarados is a dual-type Water/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Magikarp starting at level 20. Gyarados can Mega Evolve into Mega Gyarados using the Gyaradosite. Gyarados is a piscine, draconic Pokémon with a long serpentine body covered in slightly overlapping scales. It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly, and it has a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one pair of barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins. Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points. The process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the ""deity of destruction"" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in the anime that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits. Gyarados can Mega Evolve into Mega Gyarados. When it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near its tail: two on its back and two on its underside. Due the stress Mega Evolution puts on a Gyarados's body, it becomes even more ferocious than before. All other brain functions cease when Mega Evolution occurs, except for the destructive drive to burn down anything into cinders. Despite its brain having a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a Trainer it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados can launch at Mach Speed by using its orifices to release water from both sides. With this speed, it has enough power to split large ships in two. Mega Gyarados is tied with Hoopa Unbound as the tallest Dark-type. Gyarados evolves from Magikarp.",95,125,79,60,100,81
#0131,Lapras,Water, Ice,Water, Shell,Hydration,Monster, Water 1,False,"Lapras is a dual-type Water/Ice Pokémon introduced in Generation I. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Lapras can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Lapras if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Lapras is a marine reptilian Pokémon that resembles a plesiosaur. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs. Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it can understand human speech. Lapras has been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with others of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. Lapras usually sing when it is in a good mood. In the anime it was shown that Lapras can develop psychic abilities such as telepathy. In Alola, Lapras is used as a Ride Pokémon called Lapras Paddle, Alolan natives use Lapras to travel and fish for Pokémon in the water. Lapras has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship or ocarina with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras' eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell. 5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use its giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming. According to Oleana, Gigantamax Lapras's shell is not part of its body, as the shell has a logarithmic spiral structure. Gigantamax Lapras is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.",130,85,80,85,95,60
#0132,Ditto,Normal,,Limber,,Imposter,Ditto,,False,"Ditto is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Ditto is well known for its unique ability to breed with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the No Eggs Discovered group and other Ditto, including some gender-unknown Pokémon, to produce Eggs of the other's species. In its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pokémon with vestigial facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its ""head"", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile. Ditto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokémon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokémon at once. The anime, TCG, and some spin-off games have shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly attempt to transform into. It is shown to be able to transform into humans as well; however, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pokémon.On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed. Ditto is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pokémon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Imposter as an Ability. In The Indigo Disk, various Ditto Blocks can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium, where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny.",48,48,48,48,48,48

It is one of Eevee's final forms, the others being Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. Vaporeon is a Pokémon that shares physical traits with both aquatic and land animals. Vaporeon's body is light blue with a dark blue marking around its head and a spiky ridge down its spine. It has black eyes and a tiny black nose. There is a white fin encircling its neck and three fins with cream-colored webbing on its head. Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin. Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain. Vaporeon is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer. It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water. This ability enables Vaporeon to remain camouflaged while swimming, hiding itself from enemies and allowing it to ambush its prey: fish Pokémon.",130,65,60,110,95,65
#0135,Jolteon,Electric,,Volt,,Quick Feet,Field,,False,"Jolteon is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Eevee when exposed to a Thunder Stone. It is one of Eevee's final forms, the others being Vaporeon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. Jolteon is a quadrupedal, mammalian Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with a spiky fringe around its tail and a white ruff around its neck. Its ears are large and pointed with black interiors, and its eyes and small nose are black. It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad. Jolteon creates electricity using an organ in its lungs, which causes crackling noises as it exhales. It can also generate low-level electricity in its cells, which is amplified by the negative ions it gathers and generates in its fur, allowing it to discharge 10,000-volt lightning bolts. Jolteon's prickly fur is made of electrically charged needles, which create a sparking noise as it moves. It is capable of launching its fur at enemies when agitated or startled; the charge is so powerful that it can remain on the shed fur for a long time. This Pokémon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers. However, its high-strung nature and tendency toward mood swings can make it difficult to train. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, the crackling sound of electricity can be heard while Jolteon exhales during its slumber. Jolteon evolves from Eevee.",65,65,60,110,95,130

It is one of Eevee's final forms, the others being Vaporeon, Jolteon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. Flareon is a mammalian, quadrupedal Pokémon covered in short, reddish-orange fur. It has long ears with black interiors, dark eyes, and a small black nose. There are three small toes and a yellow paw pad on each foot. Fluffy yellow fur forms a small tuft on its head, as well as its bushy tail and a mane around its chest and neck. Flareon's body temperature is caused by its internal flame sac, and rises when it is excited. If its body gets too hot, it will fluff out the fur on its collar to cool down. Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in its flame sac, and then exhales it as fire with temperatures of around 3,100 °F . Flareon's average body temperature is around 1,300-1,500 °F , but it can reach 1,700 °F . It is an omnivore that roasts either Berries or prey before consumption. Flareon has a curious personality, and is mostly found in populated areas, rarely seen in the wilderness. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is believed that Flareon is regulating its body temperature while sleeping. Due its fur releasing heat to help cool it down, Flareon is able to sleep comfortably.

It is resurrected from a Helix Fossil and evolves into Omastar starting at level 40. Omanyte is a small extinct cephalopod mollusk Pokémon similar to an ammonite or nautilus. It has a sky blue body with ten tentacles and a pale yellow, helix-spiraled shell on its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omanyte's large saucer-like eyes protrude. If attacked or threatened, it quickly withdraws into its hard shell. Omanyte is considered extinct, although it can be revived from Fossils. Its fossils have been excavated in areas that were once oceans long ago. Omanyte regulated its buoyancy by storing and releasing air within its shell and controlled direction by twisting its tentacles. While Omanyte fed on plankton, it was preyed on by Archeops and Carracosta. Omanyte can now be found in the wild due to being released by people or escaping after being restored to life, causing this species to become a problem. Omanyte evolves into Omastar.",35,40,100,90,55,35

It evolves from Omanyte starting at level 40, after it is revived from a Helix Fossil. Omastar is a cephalopod mollusk Pokémon similar to an ammonite or nautilus. Its sky blue body has several tentacles; the tentacles toward the front are shorter and thicker than those in the back. There is a pale yellow, helix spiraled shell on its back. Several sharp spikes line the shell's midsection from the front to about halfway down its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omastar's eyes are visible. Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak. It is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting. Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder. It attacks only when prey comes near its tentacles. Omastar uses its tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. Its fangs are powerful enough to crush through rocks. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery.

It is mostly flat with a protective, brown shell covering its body. There are two small, black eyes on top of its shell, which it uses for sight when it hides on the ocean floor. Underneath the shell is a black space that hides the structure of its main body. Only its four short, yellow legs and a second pair of luminescent red eyes are visible on its underside. In its original time, Kabuto was prominently found on beaches, likely aided by its fast and powerful swimming ability. While it is commonly believed to be extinct, isolated populations of Kabuto have been unchanged for 300 million years. Kabuto evolves into Kabutops.",30,80,90,55,45,55

It has a flat, half-circular head with a point on each side and two small eyes on the front. It is mostly brown, except for its light gray chest and abdomen. There is a ridge down its back with three flat spines on either side and it has a flat, pointed tail. Instead of hands, its forearms have large, sharp, gray scythes. Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws. Before it went extinct, Kabutops was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home Kabutops could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids. Any leftovers left behind by Kabutops are consumed by other Pokémon. It is unknown what led to Kabutops's extinction.

#0142,Aerodactyl,Rock, Flying,Rock, Pressure,Unnerve,Flying,,False,"Aerodactyl is a dual-type Rock/Flying Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It is resurrected from an Old Amber, and while it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Aerodactyl can Mega Evolve into Mega Aerodactyl using the Aerodactylite. Aerodactyl is a reptilian, bipedal prehistoric Pokémon that resembles a pterosaur with several draconic features. It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight. Aerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pokémon to pieces, even Steel-type Pokémon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains, where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect. Aerodactyl can Mega Evolve into Mega Aerodactyl. As Mega Aerodactyl, its eyes turn bright green and parts of its body turn to stone, which some researchers believe to be its original appearance before fossilization. It grows larger and sprouts jagged black spiky rocks all over its body: five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing replacing its hands, three small spikes along its tail, one spike on each ear, and a long spike on its chin. The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge. The power of Mega Evolution allows some of Aerodactyl's dormant genes to reawaken. The rocks on Mega Aerodactyl's body are harder than diamond. Because of the burden of Mega Evolution, Mega Aerodactyl is fiercer and more irritable than before. As a result, Mega Aerodactyl attacks anything that moves.",80,105,65,60,75,130

In Generations I and II games, their remakes, and Pokémon X and Y, wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a Poké Flute or the Pokégear set to the Poké Flute channel. Snorlax is the game mascot of Pokémon Sleep. Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green mammalian Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax's bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type. Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, Snorlax can exhibit tremendous power when prompted. Snorlax is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens. Professor Neroli does research on Snorlax, particularly on their ability to attract Pokémon around them to sleep. A lot of Pokémon tend to gather around Snorlax to sleep near it or on it. Snorlax is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake. Snorlax has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small pebbles that were tangled in its belly fur go through immense growth, causing patches of grass, bushes, rocks, and a large tree to sprout upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds circling it. The Berries that grow on Gigantamax Snorlax's tree include a Sitrus Berry, a Magost Berry, and a Haban Berry. Gigantamax Snorlax almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be one of the strongest Dynamax Pokémon to have been discovered. Gigantamax Snorlax is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.",160,110,65,65,110,30
#0144,Articuno,Ice, Flying,Pressure,,Snow Cloak,,,True,"Articuno is a dual-type Ice/Flying Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation I. In Galar, Articuno has a dual-type Psychic/Flying regional form, introduced in The Crown Tundra expansion. Neither Kantonian Articuno nor Galarian Articuno are known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Along with Zapdos and Moltres, it is one of the three legendary birds of Kanto. Articuno is a large avian Pokémon with predominantly sky blue plumage and wings said to be made of ice. On its forehead is a crest that consists of three, darker blue rhombus-shaped feathers. It has circular red eyes, a short gray beak, and long, thin gray legs. Each foot has three forward-facing digits and one facing backward. On its chest is a mass of white, downy feathers. Its long, streamer-like tail is longer than its body and the same shade of blue as its crest. Articuno has the power to control ice at will. When Articuno flaps its wings, it can chill the moisture in the air around it, making snow fall. It flies from icy mountain to icy mountain. According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in Freeze Frame, Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. Articuno lives in cold, isolated locations such as snowy mountains filled with permafrost. Articuno loves Articuno Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and sang with it in the past. Articuno is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shadow Chill. Articuno has a regional form: Galarian Articuno. In Galar, Articuno has a distinct appearance. Its main body has lavender coloration with a black marking covering its chest. Its feet are black with lavender talons. The three feathers of its crest, which are longer, fused, and folded to the back, have the same purple color as its beak and tail. Its eyes glow light blue, appear to be mostly closed, and are surrounded by a black, mask-like facial disc. When Articuno utilizes its psychic power, the entire mask glows the same color as its eyes, as do the white, feather-like blades of condensed psychic power at the edges of its wings. Galarian Articuno keeps itself airborne with its psychic power, almost never having to use its wings for this purpose. Instead, the blades on its wings can be used to slice through iron as easily as paper. Its eyes can fire beams of psychic energy that leave its opponents stuck in place as if frozen solid — this is what earns this Pokémon the name of its Kantonian counterpart. It also has the ability to create mirages of itself in order to fool its opponent and escape. Its elegant and refined movements belie a cold and callous personality. It is constantly migrating around the world but can be found in the Crown Tundra once every few decades congregating with the other birds at the Dyna Tree to eat its fruits. Galarian Articuno is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Freezing Glare. In Japanese, the wording 「でんせつの れいとうポケモン」 is found in the Pokédex entry from Pokémon Blue and LeafGreen. This is a reference to Articuno's category . However, in the English version of LeafGreen, this was changed to ""legendary bird Pokémon"" instead, which is an expression also found in several other Pokédex entries of the three legendary birds.",90,85,100,95,125,85
#0145,Zapdos,Electric, Flying,Pressure,,Static,,,True,"Zapdos is a dual-type Electric/Flying Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation I. In Galar, Zapdos has a dual-type Fighting/Flying regional form, introduced in The Crown Tundra expansion. Neither Kantonian Zapdos nor Galarian Zapdos are known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Along with Articuno and Moltres, it is one of the three legendary birds of Kanto. Zapdos is a large, avian Pokémon with predominantly yellow plumage. It has small, triangular eyes with black around them and a long, thin, light orange beak. Its wings and tail are a mass of spiky feathers and there are black feathers covering the back of its wings and inner tail feathers. A large crest of spiked feathers surrounds its head. Its thighs are tan, and it has thin, light orange legs. It has feet with three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe; each toe has a short talon. When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms. It produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies; these are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms and gains power when struck by lightning. It is said to live among thunderclouds, but it is rarely seen. Zapdos loves Zapdos Treats made by Snacksworth, who once saw it fly right by him in the past. Zapdos is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shadow Bolt. Zapdos has a regional form: Galarian Zapdos. In Galar, Zapdos has a different appearance. Its body is red-orange with black plumage. Its head features yellow eyes with more pronounced, mask-like black coloration around them, a shorter black beak, and a longer, more visible neck. Its legs are black, longer, and more muscular, its thigh feathers are also black, and its talons are yellow with red rings at their bases. Its red-orange wings are smaller, with small black markings that appear to be remnants of its Kantonian counterpart's black plumage. Finally, it has a row of spiky feathers along its chest, and a similar row of black feathers on its back. Belligerent by nature and ever thirsting for battle, Galarian Zapdos seeks out opponents stronger than itself so it could test its might. Its powerful legs allow it to perform devastating kicks capable of destroying a dump truck, and it can run across mountains at up to 180 mph . Its wings have atrophied to the point that it can barely fly, but its movements are so swift that they have been compared to a lightning strike. This Pokémon earned the name of its Kantonian counterpart due to the electric-like crackling sounds that come from its feathers rubbing together. It is constantly migrating around the world but can be found in the Crown Tundra once every few decades congregating with the other birds at the Dyna Tree to eat its fruits.

#0147,Dratini,Dragon,,Shed,,Marvel Scale,Water 1, Dragon,False,"Dratini is a Dragon-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves into Dragonair starting at level 30, which evolves into Dragonite starting at level 55. Dratini is a reptilian Pokémon with a blue serpentine body and a white underside. It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes. Dratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet . As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the ""Mirage Pokémon"", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was. However in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called Coiled Sleep, Wriggly Sleep, Uncoiled Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. In Generation II, Dratini and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail. Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a ""divine Pokémon"" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps. In Generation II, Dragonair and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

A kindhearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in Great Bowls of Fire!, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with Kingdra whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the ""sea guardian"" and the ""Sea Incarnate""; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. Drayden stated in Thrash of the Titans! that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In Fiore, Dragonite used by Pokémon Rangers to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the Dragonite Bus. Dragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea. Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly. This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas. In Generation II, Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

#0150,Mewtwo,Psychic,,Pressure,,Unnerve,,,True,"Mewtwo is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation I. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into two different forms: It is a member of the Mew duo along with Mew. A unique variant of Mewtwo called Shadow Mewtwo appeared in Pokkén Tournament. Mewtwo is an artificial Pokémon. It is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb. According to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pokémon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Dr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokémon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion where horrific gene-splicing experiments were made making the Pokémon vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere. In Mewtwo Strikes Back, a Mewtwo exemplified its vicious characteristics. It was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, mind control, memory erasure, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in Genesect and the Legend Awakened also shared its aversion to contact with others but was much less belligerent. As shown in POKÉMON Detective Pikachu, Mewtwo can also transfer a human's soul into a Pokémon's body, causing this person to gain control of the Pokémon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Mewtwo can breathe in outer space. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, it's revealed Mewtwo's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells was used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist, Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life. Mewtwo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Psystrike. A unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo, is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a black tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum, draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones, which continuously increases its power. Mewtwo has two forms. Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Additionally, Shadow Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Shadow Mega Mewtwo X by using Synergy Burst. Mega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from V-shaped ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges and its digits are now longer and thinner. Its tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs. Shadow Mega Mewtwo X greatly resembles its normal counterpart, though it maintains its dark gray coloring due to the influence of the Shadow Synergy Stone. The stone's infection spreads not only to its tail, but to both of its shoulder growths, its arm ridges, and the tips of its ears. Additionally, the Y-shaped line running across its body glows the same yellowish-orange color. Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail and also slightly resembles Jessie's hairstyle. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. Despite its decreased size, it has phenomenal mental power and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought.",106,110,90,154,90,130
#0151,Mew,Psychic,,Synchronize,,,,,False,"Mew is a Psychic-type Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Mew is notable for its unique ability to learn every Technical Machine, Technical Record, Hidden Machine, and Move Tutor move . It is a member of the Mew duo along with Mewtwo. Mew was first officially revealed in the May 1996 issue of CoroCoro, less than two months after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan. Mew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known Moves, regardless of their Types. It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink. According to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, Dr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it. According to the anime's radio drama, The Birth of Mewtwo, Mew was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode In the Palms of our Hands! it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokémon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back. Mew is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Genesis Supernova. The Pokédex entry from Japanese Pokémon Blue and LeafGreen had some localization changes: In the German version of Pokémon Stadium, Mew's entry does not mention South America; instead, it says that Mew has been seen in ""Niemandsland"" .",100,100,100,100,100,100

Its soothing, regenerative powers can even affect those who stand nearby. Meganium tends to be very docile and has been portrayed as a peacemaker in the anime. It can rarely be found living in grasslands. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, many Pokémon tend to sleep peacefully side-by-side with Meganium. The reason is fragrance given off by Meganium's flower sooths and calms emotions of any Pokémon fighting near it. A special Meganium is worshiped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pokémon. It resides in the Florio Island Illumina Spot.

Most of its body is cream-colored, but its back and the top of its head are a dark green-blue. It has a short, rounded snout and small, triangular eyes and ears. When its mouth is open, its sharp canine teeth and thick tongue are visible. Each of its paws has five digits and there is a coarse, spiky fringe of fur along its rear. Across the back of its neck, several red spots can produce fire. Typhlosion is capable of making anything go up in flames when angered and creating explosions by rubbing its fur together. The heat it generates when ready for battle creates a shimmering haze that can also be used to hide itself. When fully enraged, anything Typhlosion touches instantly goes up in flames. Though it is rare in the wild, it can be found living on grasslands. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Typhlosion is known to toss and turn while sleeping. It is recommended to avoid a sleeping Typhlosion due to it unleashing blasts fires from its back by accident. Typhlosion has a regional form: Hisuian Typhlosion. Hisuian Typhlosion's appearance is believed to have been influenced by the energy emanating from Mount Coronet at the center of the Hisui region. Its ears droop beside its head. The fur on its back is a purplish-blue color, and extends to the front of its neck, forming a collar pattern. It has fire-producing spots all around its neck, covering the collar pattern, and these spots produce flames that wisp in a bright magenta red color. Hisuian Typhlosion has graceful and refined movements, and a gentler, more pacifistic nature compared to Johtonian Typhlosion. It can often be seen staring into space; it is assumed that as Hisuian Typhlosion does this, it looks at the flow of life energy and searches for wayward spirits and lost souls to eat. It is believed that Hisuian Typhlosion purifies spirits with its flames as it eats them before it guides them back to the afterlife where they belong. Despite its peaceful nature, Hisuian Typhlosion can lose control of its emotions when sufficiently angered and can unleash ghost flames that can incinerate its opponents until nothing remains. It can emit a total of 108 ghost flames from the spots on its neck. Once unleashed, every single ghost flame attacks its opponents while taking on the appearance of ferocious beasts. Hisuian Typhlosion is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Infernal Parade. Typhlosion evolves from Quilava and is the final form of Cyndaquil. In Hisui, Typhlosion has a regional form that evolves from Quilava and is the final form of Cyndaquil.",78,84,78,109,85,100

It evolves into Croconaw starting at level 18, which evolves into Feraligatr starting at level 30. Along with Chikorita and Cyndaquil, Totodile is one of the three first partner Pokémon of Johto available at the beginning of Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. Totodile is a bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon with well-developed jaws. It has red eyes with ridges above them, black markings around its eyes, and several sharp teeth. On its chest is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends to its arms; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Totodile has five fingers and three toes. Down its back is a row of three red spines with a small, red ridge on either side. The tip of its tail has a single red spine as well. Totodile tends to be both playful and rough by nature and has a habit of biting anything it sees, including its Trainer. Despite its size, Totodile's jaws are capable of crushing anything, so it sometimes causes serious injuries. Turning one's back on Totodile is considered to be a bad idea as it can bite without warning. Totodile are scarce in the wild, though it can be found around bodies of water like rivers, ponds, and lakes. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Totodile and its evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep. This practice is hypothesized to be a defense mechanism against enemy attacks. Totodile evolves into Croconaw, which evolves into Feraligatr.",50,65,64,44,48,43

It has well-developed, rounded jaws with two fangs visible in the corners of the lower jaw even when closed. Its eyes are red with black markings around them. There are three clusters of red spikes on its body: one with three points on top of its head, one with two points between its shoulders, and a diamond-shaped one near the tip of its tail. While most of its body is blue, its lower jaw is yellow and there is an asymmetrical, yellow-and-blue pattern around its chest that resembles a spotted animal skin. Although Croconaw is described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible. The tips of its teeth are slanted backward similar to a barbed fish hook; this makes them impossible to remove once embedded in something. Once Croconaw has bitten down onto something, it will not let go until it loses its teeth; any missing teeth will quickly grow back. Croconaw can rarely be found near water. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Croconaw and its evolutionary relatives are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep. During sleep, as one half of Croconaw's brain rests, the eye on the same side opens. This allows Croconaw to watch for enemy attacks while it sleeps.

On its lower body is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends up to its thighs; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Its arms have five clawed fingers each, and its feet three clawed toes. Feraligatr opens its powerful jaws to intimidate its foes and viciously shakes its head once it clamps down on foes or prey. Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of the water, it has been known to move on all fours. However, when hunting or fighting, it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. Feraligatr can rarely be found living near the water's edge. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Feraligatr and its pre-evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep.

It has cream-colored tips on its ears, two brown, whisker-like markings on each cheek, and round, black eyes. Its four limbs are stubby; the forepaws are brown and the hind paws are cream-colored. Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs but prefers to move on all fours. Its body and tail are so similar in structure that it is impossible to tell where its tail begins. Despite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile. This allows Furret to escape even when in the arms of a human. Its speed allows it to catch prey such as Rattata. It tends to burrow under the ground of meadows and other temperate grasslands. Its narrow burrows are well-suited for its slim body and are very difficult for other Pokémon to enter. The burrows also become more maze-like deeper inside, which makes it even harder to find Furret's nest. A mother Furret curls itself around its offspring to help them sleep. Once the offspring are older, the mother Furret will take them outside to prepare them for independence. In Lental, Mightyena is a natural predator of Furret.

As seen in the anime, Hoothoot's feathers can grow to be shaggy, and the protrusions on its head droop. It has two pinkish feet, each with five-clawed toes. However, it will typically only stand on one foot at a time and alternates between the two at speeds too difficult to track with the naked eye. Hoothoot begins crying at the same time every day and always tilts its head in the same rhythm. This ability is due to a special internal organ that senses the world's rotation, allowing it to keep track of time. As a result, Hoothoot was once considered a divine messenger sent to tell the time. Some countries see Hoothoot as a deity of wisdom. Historically, people raised Hoothoot to serve as clocks — a practice still done by some Trainers today. Hoothoot is most commonly found nesting in trees in temperate and boreal forests.

Along with its main green coloration, Xatu's design has accents of black, yellow, and red. There is an extra set of yellow stripes on a male Xatu. It has almond eyes, a long, slightly hooked beak, and two long, red feather crests. Xatu's feet have only two toes, one in front and one in back. Xatu's design is similar to a totem pole or a kachina doll. Xatu tends to stand still all day, constantly observing the sun's movement. One theory explains that Xatu can see into the future with its right eye and the past with its left, and it does not move due to fears of its visions of the future coming true. The anime has shown that it can communicate by moving its wings in a semaphore fashion. Xatu is believed to live in the forests of South America. Xatu evolves from Natu.",65,75,70,95,70,95

It evolves into Flaaffy starting at level 15, which evolves into Ampharos starting at level 30. Mareep is an ovine Pokémon with fluffy cream-colored wool covering its entire body, as well as a curly tuft of wool in the middle of its head. Its head is blue, and it has black eyes. Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times. Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern. Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb. This sphere glows brighter the more electricity and heat it has. Mareep's wool grows continuously and stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battles in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used in high-quality clothing. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Mareep is known to roll over in its sleep. Mareep evolves into Flaaffy, which evolves into Ampharos.",55,40,40,65,45,35

It evolves from Mareep starting at level 15 and evolves into Ampharos starting at level 30. Flaaffy is a pink, bipedal, ovine Pokémon. It has thick, conical ears with black stripes on the sides of its head and small, blue eyes. A white mane of wool covers its head and upper body. This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head. It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot. Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb. Storing too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool. The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents. Flaaffy typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields, though it can also be found in farms, where its wool is used to create high-quality clothing. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, on rare occasions a sleeping Flaaffy's tail can be seen lighting up after being fully charged. Flaaffy evolves from Mareep and evolves into Ampharos.",70,55,55,80,60,45

Ampharos was officially revealed in the May 1997 issue of CoroCoro, along with Donphan and Slowking. Ampharos is a yellow, bipedal ovine Pokémon with a white belly. It has conical ears with black stripes and a red orb on its forehead. Its long neck has several black rings around it near the base. Its stubby arms resemble flippers and each foot has a single white nail. It has a long, black-striped tail with a red orb at the tip. The orb on its tail can shine so bright, that it can be seen from space. People have used the light as a beacon, or to send signals across the ocean. Ampharos is generally found in grasslands, though it can also be found in farms alongside its pre-evolved forms Mareep and Flaaffy. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, the tail light of a sleeping Ampharos can sometimes seen in the distance at night.The reason is due to Ampharos forgetting to turn off its tail light before going to sleep. Ampharos can Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos. As Mega Ampharos, its toes turn black and it regrows white wool at the back of its head and over its tail, having its genes stimulated by Mega Evolution. This energy also awakens its long-sleeping dragon blood. Its long wooly tail has many small, red orbs attached to it. Its conical ears retain their stripes but are now segmented with swirled tips. When it increases the amount of electrical energy within itself, the red orbs on its body and wool emit a strong light.

It has a nearly spherical shape with a white belly and it has round ears with red insides. These sensitive ears can detect distant sounds. Marill's arms and feet are short and possess no visible digits. There is a blue, bubble-like ball at the tip of its zigzagging black tail. The tail is flexible and configured to stretch, and the ball is full of oil that acts as a buoy to help keep Marill afloat. The ball at the tip of its tail can glow when Marill attacks. In the anime, Marill was shown to be able to bounce on its tail. In the TCG, Marill is shown to rapidly spin its tail, seemingly readying for an attack. Marill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast-moving stream. Marill never gets cold after swimming in cold water, due to its water-repellent fur drying up quickly the moment it leaves the water. It lives on the water's edge. Prior to Generation VI, Marill and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Huge Power as an Ability.

Azumarill is a blue, bipedal semiaquatic leporine Pokémon that has an ovoid body. The lower half of its body is white with a white, bubble-like pattern above it, which helps to camouflage it in water. It has elongated, rabbit-like ears with red insides and circular eyes. When in the water, it rolls up its ears to prevent the insides from becoming wet. Its arms and feet are short with rounded ends and no discernible digits. It has a black zigzagging tail with a blue, bubble-like tip. The tip of its tail tends to glow when it attacks or is excited. Azumarill has highly developed hearing that allows it to hear distances, even when it is underwater. By keeping still and listening closely, it can identify prey even in wild, fast-moving rivers. If Azumarill spots a drowning Pokémon, it will make an air bubble that helps them breathe or when Azurill are playing near the rivers. It lives in rivers and lakes and can live in the water all day long. Prior to Generation VI and in Generation IX, Azumarill and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Huge Power as an Ability.

In Generation II, its remakes, and Pokémon Emerald, wild Sudowoodo can be found blocking the road in inconvenient locations in Johto and Hoenn. In order to engage it in battle, a Trainer must first squirt it with water from either a SquirtBottle or Wailmer Pail. Sudowoodo is a Pokémon that has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet, and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends of its fingers. It has a forked ""branch"" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, Sudowoodo's composition is closer to a rock than a plant. Originally, it was incorrectly believed to be a Grass-type. Sudowoodo disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. Sudowoodo's camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests, sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Sudowoodo is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping. However, it will occasionally let of this stance and sleep instead on the ground. In Generation II, Mimic was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

The leaves on its head have ragged edges, similar to a dandelion. It has big, triangular ears with dark insides, and beady yellow eyes that lack pupils. Its arms and legs are stubby, and it has a short tail with a rounded tip. There is a circular yellow pad on the underside of each foot. Hoppip's body is very light, and it is easily lifted off the ground by winds and will drift in the air. Hoppip can sense approaching strong winds. In order to avoid being blown away, it clusters and links leaves with other Hoppip or grips the ground firmly with its feet. However, it enjoys gentle breezes. Hoppip tends to be carried by the winds across vast distances, and thus can be found all over the world except in cold regions.

It has large, flat ears on the sides of its head and oval, orange eyes with no pupils. On top of its head is a yellow bloom with a white center. Skiploom spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 °F . Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer. It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains. If the weather gets too cold, Skiploom will fly away and migrate to warmer regions so that it can photosynthesize. Some people claim to be able to determine a Skiploom's birth location by the scent coming off of its flower. Skiploom lives in temperate grasslands. As seen in the games, the bloom on its head can turn clockwise. Skiploom evolves from Hoppip and evolves into Jumpluff.",55,45,50,45,65,80

Three cotton puffs, almost as large as the body itself, extend off it: one on each arm, and one on top of its head. These puffs produce cotton spores that Jumpluff can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane. Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff. Jumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread cotton spores as it floats around to create offspring; inhaling these spores may cause coughs and itchiness. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating. Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open temperate grasslands. Once Jumpluff runs out of its cotton spores, its journey — and its life — reaches its end.

Its face usually has a cheeky smile and round, blue eyes. With its round ears, Aipom's head is disproportionately large compared to its body. Atop its head is a cowlick that is longer on females than males. Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs. Aipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes. The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects. Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall. Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous and become clumsy over time. Aipom lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch.

Its body has three broad, brown, vertical stripes. Two of the stripes start jaggedly above Sunkern's dark eyes and continue downward. The other stripe is directly below Sunkern's mouth. Since Sunkern's eyelids are brown, the brown streak patterning appears uninterrupted when Sunkern's eyes are closed. Its beady eyes are black with white pupils. Sunkern is known to be very weak. Aware of its weakness, it only feeds until it evolves. However, it feeds on only the dew from under the leaves of plants. It tries to move as little as possible since it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for evolution. If attacked by predators such as Spearow, it shakes its leaves at the attacker. Sunkern occasionally falls from the sky on early mornings for unknown reasons. A year after a cold summer, the population of Sunkern explodes. Sunkern can be found in temperate, grassy meadows. Sunkern evolves into Sunflora.",30,30,30,30,30,30

The petals become more vivid as the weather becomes warmer. Sunflora's face has two eyes that appear perpetually closed, and a thin line running vertical beside each eye. Sunflora has leaves extending like arms from its round body and two toes on each foot. Sunflora converts sunlight into nutrition. Because of this, it tends to pursue sunlight and is always looking in the direction of the sun. While the sun is up, it moves around in a hectic manner.

A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body at 360 degrees without even moving its head. This allows Yamma to have a high evasiveness. The end of Yanma's tail has two flat extensions from the sides and two gray spikes in the center. Yanma is a skillful flier. It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed. Yamma's eyes ensure the prey will not escape its sight, even when behind. It can also generate shock waves capable of breaking glass or even launching a house skyward by flapping its wings very fast. Yanma is often found in wooded and swampy areas. It hunts insects for food, using its eyesight to spot and its flight abilities to pursue prey. Yanma is also territorial, flitting around to guard its territory.

Wooper is a mostly blue, amphibious Pokémon that resembles an upright, armless axolotl. Wooper's head is large compared to its body, and it has small, round, black eyes. It has purple, branching gills on either side of its head; the males have more branches in its gills than the females. Wooper stands on two small, round feet, and it has a large, thick tail. On its belly are dark blue curved markings. It is implied in the anime that Wooper is a dull-witted Pokémon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded. It is a timid Pokémon and tends to stay close to Quagsire. Arbok is a natural predator of Wooper. Wooper has a regional form: Paldean Wooper. Wooper in the Paldea region has a brown coloration, with two pairs of bone-shaped gills branching from its head, as well as an eight-pronged pattern on its stomach. Paldean Wooper once lived in the water during ancient times until they were forced out of their territory. As a result, they gradually adapted to living on land, namely in marshes. Paldean Wooper employs two adaptations to allow it to survive on land: its gills have hardened, and it coats its body with a poisonous film that keeps it from drying out. However, these adaptations resulted in Paldean Wooper having heavy bodies and being only able to move really slowly. To defend itself, Paldean Wooper can use its gills to unleash a powerful poisonous liquid. Paldean Wooper travel and work together in groups of three or four, and enlist the help of their evolutionary relative, Clodsire, to ferry them across water.

A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery. Quagsire shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire. Quagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pokémon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water. In the anime, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.

The feathery crest is smaller on the female than on the male. It has semi-circular, red eyes with white sclerae and pupils and a spiky collar of feathers around its neck. The shaggy feathers on its tail resemble the end of a broom, and there is a thin, red band at the base of the tail. Its yellow feet have four toes, three facing forward and one backward. Murkrow awakens at dusk and moves during the night. It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokémon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, ""Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come,"" would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a Murkrow. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket's ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks amongst forests and swamps. Murkrow may also act as a servant of Honchkrow; with groups of at least 100 flying in at Honchkrow's call. There is a saying for Murkrow that goes, ""Get home before the Murkrow fly.""

While it has no visible arms or legs, its lower half has several small appendages and resembles a ruffled dress. It has five round red gems halfway around its neck, which are used to absorb fear and use it as nourishment. When defeated in the side series games, its body disappears, leaving only the gems around its neck behind. This implies that Misdreavus retreats into the gems when it has been severely weakened.

All of them are known as One form, as seen in the Pokédex. In Generation II, there were 26 Unown forms based on Latin alphabet characters. In Generation III, two new forms were introduced as well: ? and ! . The Unown forms are chronicled in the Unown Mode and the Unown Report. In Generation II, its shape is determined by its individual values; in Generation III, it is determined by its personality value; from Generation IV onwards, it is determined by a separate form identifier. Unown is a flat, thin Pokémon shaped like an eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers. The Pokédex and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pokégear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an ""odd power"" emerges when more than one Unown come together. In Generation VIII, Hidden Power is Unown's signature move. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Poké Balls that contained Pokémon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the anime, it is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown. Unown is an extremely rare Pokémon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pokémon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins.

There are two eyespots on its black tail. Its eyespots are revealed to be capable of blinking and looking around using its tail in the Pokémon Stadium series. Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked. Wobbuffet is usually a docile Pokémon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pokémon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food. Because of its overprotective nature regarding its tail and hatred of light, Wobbuffet lives in dark caves. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Wobbuffet is known to keep its tail hidden even while it sleeps. However, it will drop its guard when deeply asleep, exposing its tail completely. Prior to Generation V, Wobbuffet and its pre-evolved form, Wynaut, were the only known Pokémon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability. Wobbuffet evolves from Wynaut.",190,33,58,33,58,33

Pineco is an insectoid Pokémon encased in a blue-green, pine cone-like shell that protects it from bird Pokémon. It has red eyes and no visible limbs, along with a single spike on top of its head, which is supposedly its stem. It makes its shell thicker by gluing tree bark to its body. The glue is made of fluid that Pineco spits out, which hardens when it is exposed to air. Pineco's shell becomes bigger and thicker as more tree bark is accumulated; older Pineco are very large in size. Unbothered by the added weight of its shell, Pineco patiently hangs from a tree branch in tropical and temperate forests, waiting to prey on flying insects. In Alola, its favorite prey is Cutiefly. Typically immobile, it will drop to the ground and explode if someone shakes its tree while it is eating. Pineco evolves into Forretress.",50,65,90,35,35,15

The outer plates have zigzagging ridges that open along its back and front, revealing its smooth, red inner shell. The inner shell is punctuated by four cylindrical spikes, each tapering to an open point. Between the spikes, the inner shell opens along a straight line to reveal Forretress's eyes, which are round with large pupils. Whatever else lies inside its shell is unknown. Forretress can defend itself from enemies by shooting out pieces of its outer shell, as a conditioned reflex rather than a conscious effort. It opens its shell to capture prey, but this happens so quickly that its interior body cannot be seen. It lives in tropical and temperate forests, attaching itself immovably to tree trunks.

It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Heracross is known to occasionaly sleep while licking the sap it finds.The reason is due to Heracross becoming exhausted from a potentinally hard search for sweet sap. It lives in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, where it feeds on tree sap. In Generation II, Megahorn was its signature move. As seen in the anime, Heracross has been known to compete with Pokémon such as Pinsir for food.

Living in frigid temperatures, Swinub is covered in dense, brown, striped hair to keep it warm. The hair is so shaggy that it often covers its tuft-like small legs, making it appear like a legless lump. Swinub's eyes appear as if they are perpetually closed. The only time that Swinub's eyes have been seen open was in Pokémon Adventures, during the battle between Pryce and Erika in Bringing up Bellossom, when Pryce ordered his Swinub to dodge Erika's Skiploom's attack. Swinub uses its pink, pig-like nose to dig through mud and snow, looking for anything edible. In Hisui, ancient people relied on Swinub a lot because of this skill. Occasionally, it will come across hot springs while scouring the ground. Its favorite food is a type of mushroom that grows beneath dead grass, though it also eats Berries. When a Swinub finds an attractive smell, it will run desperately to find out the source of the aroma. It inhabits cold places, such as icy caves, mountainous regions, and frozen tundra.

These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female Piloswine than on a male. It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound. Piloswine has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur. As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead. As a result, Piloswine is constantly charging at foes when it moves. The hairs on its back stands up straight as a warning sign for this. Piloswine's thick fur allows it to survive in harshly cold environments that it inhabits, such as icy caves, mountainous regions and frozen tundra. Its fur is so long that it usually covers its small, hooved legs. Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground.

#0222,Corsola,Water, Rock,Hustle, Natural,Regenerator,Water 1, Water 3,False,"Corsola is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation II. In Galar, Corsola has a Ghost-type regional form. Galarian Corsola evolves into Cursola starting at level 38. Johtonian Corsola is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Anthozoan Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a light-blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby. Smaller Pokémon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the anime. Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night. Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on Corsola in the Galar region, having not developed a taste for its branches. Corsola has a regional form: Galarian Corsola. Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in the climate and ocean temperature, turning them into Ghost-types. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms and branches have a distinctly semitransparent appearance to them. These branches are incorporeal and can disappear at will. They cannot cause injuries or pain, but they can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others, and will immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go. Galarian Corsola are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident. Galarian Corsola consumes spirit energy from the life force its absorbs. This diet eventually causes Corsola's shell to break, its body to become incorporeal and its spirit energy to pour out, thus completing its evolution into Cursola.",55,55,85,65,85,35

If a Remoraid is in the party when a Mantyke levels up, the Mantyke evolves into Mantine. However, this will not affect the Remoraid and it continues to be a separate Pokémon. Remoraid is a light blue piscine Pokémon with saucer-like eyes and a mouth with four pointed teeth. There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver. It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. It was once believed that Remoraid would not truly evolve into Octillery, due to their vastly differing appearances. Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the ""sniper of the seas."" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward. Remoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke, helping it achieve its evolution into Mantine. Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pokémon, travelling downstream from rivers especially when evolution draws near. Remoraid evolves into Octillery.",35,65,35,65,35,65

Octillery is a red, cephalopod-like Pokémon with large, round eyes and a turret-like mouth. There are yellow bumps on its rock-hard head and yellow suction cups on each of its eight tentacles. These suction cups and yellow bumps are smaller on a female Octillery. It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away. Octillery is a relaxed Pokémon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. Octillery's ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. Octillery also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Octillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pokémon Snap, an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper. Octillery evolves from Remoraid.",75,105,75,105,75,45

It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out. Prior to Generation IX, Delibird was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest.

Mantine thrives in open seas where it swims freely, often in schools where they race one another. It can breach out of the water and fly 300 feet into the air if it builds up enough speed. In the past, it was often misidentified as a bird Pokémon by observers who saw this behavior. Mantine is sometimes seen with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one of its fins, scavenging for its leftovers and fighting together with it when attacked. Mantine has a docile nature, and does not mind the Remoraid clinging onto its fin. In Alola, many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine. This has made it an icon in the region, being featured on souvenir postcards and posters. Mantine evolves from Mantyke.",65,40,70,80,140,70

There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 185 mph . Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends. Its steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharp enough to be used as blades and sharper than any man-made sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pokémon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords. It is a popular Pokémon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar, it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight. In Blueberry Academy, Skarmory is used for the school's Flying Taxi service. In Generation V, Steel Wing was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.",65,80,140,40,70,70

Atop its head is a pair of long, curved gray horns. These horns are smaller on the female than the male. Unlike its pre-evolution, it does not have discernable ears. Houndoom live in packs. The one with its horns raked sharply towards the back serves a leadership role. Leadership is determined by fights within the pack. It is believed that Houndoom dreams about this leadership role while it sleeps. Its gut is full of toxins, which are used to create unique fire mixed with poison. This gives Houndoom's fire a foul odor and the burns it inflicts will never heal. After finishing off its prey, Houndoom divides it evenly among its pack. Houndoom appears near rough terrain areas. Its howling induces shivering in other Pokémon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests. In the past, people thought Houndoom's howl came from the grim reaper. Houndoom usually breathes fire when it is angry. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Houndoom is known to rarely breathe out flames while it sleeps. Houndoom can Mega Evolve into Mega Houndoom. As Mega Houndoom, the ridges on its back thicken, and it gains additional bone-like rings around the base of its tail. The rings on its tail have small spikes on top resembling vertebrae. The ridge at the base of Mega Houndoom's neck is longer and curves forward towards its shoulders. Instead of a band with a skull pendant, there is a large, toothed structure around its neck. This bone-like formation has two large spikes on either side and three pointed teeth on the bottom. Mega Houndoom's horns now point straight up with a small, outward curve in the middle. The two bands on its hind legs have vanished, and those on its forelegs are broken in the front. Its claws are a dark red due to its ability to generate more heat, which causes pain to Mega Houndoom. Finally, the tip of its tail is now split down the middle. When it Mega Evolves, its entire body generates heat. Its fiery breath is now powerful enough to burn foes into ashes.

Its four short legs are each encircled with a broken, black band and have three toes. Donphan has the ability to curl up into a ball and violently roll around like a wheel. These rolling tackles are strong enough to knock down a house. While normally calm, Donphan can become enraged and start a rampage. Once it starts its rampage, it will be almost unstoppable. Donphan will chase after anyone who angers it. The anime shows that this ability is further used as a form of courtship. The male Donphan have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. A Donphan's tough hide is so strong, not even a car can scratch it. Despite this, the armor is extremely vulnerable to rain. It has been demonstrated that Donphan has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite . Donphan travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd. It lives in rough, mountainous terrain. Both Great Tusk and Iron Treads share a resemblance to Donphan. Great Tusk is theorized to be Donphan's ancient ancestor from the dinosaur era, while Iron Treads is believed to be a descendant of Donphan or a scientific weapon sent to the Pokémon world by aliens.

It has a large, brown nose and a pair of pale cream-colored antlers, each with a black orb in the center. The shape of the antlers and the black orbs causes them to resemble eyes. Stantler can distort reality and create illusions with its antlers by subtly changing the flow of air around them. Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand. The orbs on the antlers have a pleasant scent, which can induce a bewildering effect on people. The orbs can also be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping. Stantler's strange antlers were very valuable as works of art, and as such, the species was nearly hunted to extinction. Stantler live in herds in temperate, mountainous forests; these herds are sometimes led by a Wyrdeer. As shown in the anime, a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats. In the past, Stantler lived in tougher environments with more enemies, which strengthened its psychic powers and allowed it to evolve into Wyrdeer. Stantler and its evolved form, Wyrdeer, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Psyshield Bash. In Hisui, Stantler evolves into Wyrdeer.",73,95,62,85,65,85

Smeargle is best known for its ability to use the move Sketch, which permanently copies the last move used by the opponent. Due to this, it can legitimately have any move in the Pokémon games except for Chatter, Struggle, and Shadow moves — though it can learn Dark Void and Hyperspace Fury, it cannot use those moves as they can only be used by specific Pokémon. As a result of this, it can pass on any Egg Move to Pokémon in the Field Egg Group. Smeargle is a bipedal, beagle-like Pokémon with white and brown fur. It has a long tail with an end resembling a paintbrush. This paintbrush oozes with paint, and the color of the paint may vary for each Smeargle, as well as change in hue corresponding to its emotions. Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is typically the same color as the paint on the tip of its tail, though Smeargle can have seperate back and tail colors in Pokémon Stadium 2. The mark is placed on Smeargle's back as a sign of adulthood. Smeargle's in-game appearances in Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal as well as Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness all depict it with red paint on its back and tail while its Shiny coloration is depicted with green; the inverse is true in the Generation III core series games and in every game from Generation IV onwards.

Silcoon is a cocoon-like Pokémon that uses silk to attach itself to tree branches. It is almost completely covered in white silk with only two small holes. A pair of red eyes can be seen through the holes, but they are partially hidden by a rough fringe of silk. The silk forms a hard cocoon that it can use to repel enemy attacks. Dew and rainwater collect on the silk, which provides Silcoon with nourishment. Silcoon lives in forests, where it conserves energy by moving as little as possible. This energy, which it had gathered as a Wurmple, serves as fuel for its further evolution. Due to its cocoon, Silcoon cannot extend its limbs and can only move really slowly. However, its eyes allow it to be on the lookout for danger. Silcoon evolves from Wurmple and evolves into Beautifly.",50,35,55,25,25,15

The upper pair of wings are larger and have a line of yellow along the top edge, while each of the lower wings has a long, round-tipped extension on the bottom. The female's wings have smaller red spots than the male's. Beautifly has a long and curled black proboscis that it uses to gather pollen and nectar — its favorite food — from flowers. Its diet also includes water, fruit juices, and bodily fluids from its prey, all of which it sucks up with its proboscis. Despite its appearance, Beautifly is known to be aggressive and greedy; it will jab at foes with its proboscis if it is disturbed while collecting pollen. The preferred habitats of a Beautifly are forests, where it rides the spring winds while searching for pollen. It competes with Combee for nectar.

The soft silk hardens into a tough cocoon that is able to endure attacks, and Cascoon will not move even when it is attacked. However, it never forgets the pain it endures and seeks revenge upon evolution. It lives in forests, where it hides underneath large leaves and inside the gaps of tree branches. Additionally, it camouflages itself by attaching dead leaves to its body. As its cells create energy for evolution, the inside of the cocoon becomes hot. Cracks start to form in its casing when evolution is near. Cascoon's silk is said to be thin yet strong, with a luster and texture superior to the silk from its counterpart Silcoon.

This Pokémon has two pairs of red, stubby legs and yellow, stylized compound eyes. There is a pair of fuzzy, yellow antennae on top of Dustox's head, which are smaller on the female. These antennae are used to seek food. Dustox is nocturnal and is instinctively drawn to light. Swarms are attracted by the bright light of cities, where they wreak havoc by devouring the leaves off roadside trees. When attacked, Dustox unleashes toxic scales from its wings; these toxins are powerful enough to make even a pro wrestler sick.

The female has thinner stripes than the male. Ludicolo has large, green hands with two black lines on its palms, and thick green legs with a black circle on the underside of its feet. Ludicolo becomes more powerful when it hears festive music and will appear near laughing children on hikes. The reason is due to structures in Ludicolo's body that can produce energy when hit by sound waves with a cheerful rhythm. As it becomes more energetic and active, it will break into a dance. This allows Ludicolo to face enemies without fear. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Ludicolo is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found near the water's edge.

Its eyes are very small, and it has a round, blue nose. It has several blue barbels that are used as a superb radar in murky water and can be used for taste as well. These whiskers are left exposed when it hides in the mud to wait for prey. There are two rounded, blue pectoral fins and a single dorsal fin, all of which have black spots. Its tail fin is also rounded and blue but possesses no spots. A slimy film covers its body, which protects Barboach from bacteria and allows it to easily escape from predators like Bird Pokémon. Barboach remains in its aquatic environment to prevent itself from drying out and becoming weak. Barboach can use its whiskers to detect the location of its prey, and to detect both smell and flavor similar to a human. Barboach evolves into Whiscash.",50,48,43,46,41,60

Whiscash uses its caudal fin to cause earthquakes that can extend for over three miles by hitting the bottom of swamp beds. Whiscash can predict when natural earthquakes will occur. It also uses these massive earthquakes to drive away any foes that come near it, going on rampages in the process. This behavior, along with sightings of Whiscash's leaping from lakes, has caused people to mistaken it for starting earthquakes. It lives in a nest at the bottom of ponds and swamps, and is territorial over them. Whiscash tends to wait silently for prey to come to it. This gluttonous fish will eat anything that is alive, sometimes whole, and has been shown in the anime to eat inanimate objects as well. Whiscash also has a diet of consuming mud.

It also has a long skinny tail that is usually curled tightly in a spiral. Kecleon is able to change the colors of its body at will and is known for frequently using this ability to camouflage itself. However, it is unable to change the color of its red stripe. Its color also changes based on its mood and health, darkening in color with better health. By using camouflage to appear almost invisible, it can sneak up on prey and ensnare it with its long pink tongue. If unnoticed for too long, though, it pouts and may never reveal itself. This Pokémon lives in tropical and temperate forests. Although Kecleon typically appears as green with yellow stripes, it is known to possess various non-Shiny color variations. A purplish variant of Kecleon has been seen in the anime, the TCG, and the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series; the purplish Kecleon in the latter also has light-green outlines rather than yellow. Blue, red, and brown variants of Kecleon have made a singular appearance in the TCG. Whether these variants are an example of it changing color or if they are different kinds of Kecleon is unclear.

It has a long neck with a thin black line around it. It uses its neck for reaching treetops to gorge on its most favored fruit. Since it ate only this kind of fruit continuously, the fruit began to grow around its neck. These yellow, banana-like fruits can be picked and consumed by other Pokémon or humans, and grow twice a year because of the rapid production of sugar in Tropius's leaves. Its feet have toenails the same color as its fruit. In warm areas, there are ranches that raise Tropius. In Alola, its fruit is especially sweet compared to those of other regions.

Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and dewclaw-like spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs. It walks with a pacing gait like that of a bear. Absol lives in the mountains far from civilization, and it rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur and will try to warn people when one is approaching. Absol is also known to protect fields from natural disasters as well. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. The hatred for Absol was started years ago by superstitions surrounding about it. Despite this, others are interested in its ability to predict disaster. Absol has been referred to as a bringer of doom. Absol can move as swiftly as the wind. Absol is said to have a lifespan of up to 100 years. Absol can Mega Evolve into Mega Absol. As Mega Absol, its fur is longer overall, and the increased energy coursing through its body makes the fur at the back of its mane stand on end so that it appears to have wings. The spikes on its heels and elbows grow larger, and the fur in these areas becomes longer as well. Its sickle-shaped horn widens, while an additional, smaller horn appears on the opposite side of its head. Its tail now has a more saw-like shape, and the oval marking on its forehead is now a rounded triangle. Mega Absol emits a fearsome aura that has been known to kill fainthearted people from shock.

It has circular, light blue eyes, wide teeth, and spherical hands and feet that lack digits. It is covered with a yellow cloak that gives it a triangular outline. The coat is rimmed with an orange stripe and has three orange diamond markings on the back. As its evolved form Glalie has a body of rock, Snorunt may also be made of rock. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, defeating a Snorunt, Glalie, or Froslass will yield some ""Snorunt fur"", suggesting the cloak is made of fur. Well-adapted to life in colder climates, it subsists on snow and ice and can survive temperatures as low as −150 degrees Fahrenheit. Snorunt is also a social creature, living and traveling with other Snorunt in groups of five. The group can live together in harmony while residing underneath giant leaves. It can be found in caves, particularly when the outside lacks snow or areas with heavy snowfall. Despite this, the Snorunt population in Alola shows it can survive in some places with warm weather. Additionally, it has been known to visit human dwellings. There is a legend that any home a Snorunt visits and lives near will prosper for generations. There is a tradition where houses would leave a lump of ice made from pure water for Snorunt to have when visiting. Playing with Snorunt is a favorite childhood memory for rich people who live in cold areas.

Glalie is a spherical Pokémon that consists of a black rock core covered by ice. The icy covering has several holes and spaces across this Pokémon's body. Blue eyes and a mouth with flat teeth are visible through three of these holes. There are two large, black, conical horns on either side of Glalie's head. There is a legend that says Glalie was born from a boulder that has absorbed the distress and regrets from any mountaineers that got lost on icy mountains. Glalie's icy body is actually rock that is not particularly hard. When covered in ice, its body becomes harder than steel. It does not melt, and it can control ice by instantly freezing moisture in the air into any desirable shape. This ability is used to drape itself in ice armor and freeze its prey, which it then consumes whole. It prefers consuming Pokémon that are already frozen, such as Vanillite. It can be found in caves, particularly when the outside weather lacks snow. In the anime, it is shown that Glalie has the ability to make itself float in midair, akin to flying, and move around to even serve as a mode of transport. Glalie can Mega Evolve into Mega Glalie. Mega Glalie's jaw is dislocated because of the overwhelming energy, causing its mouth to extend to the length of its face. The lower jaw is all black except for two light-blue, conical, icy spikes. The pupils in Mega Glalie's eyes are now red instead of black. The horns on top Mega Glalie's head have been partially turned into ice, with the addition of a third horn on its forehead. Mega Glalie can spill endless blizzards from its broken mouth, though it gets irritated by the fact that it can no longer consume its prey. The areas Mega Glalie often appears in, will cause the area to be whited out. Any prey that it envelopes within its mouth is frozen instantly.

This covering of fluffy fur, combined with the layer of blubber underneath, retains heat and protects Spheal from the cold. It has black, circular eyes; small tusks protruding from its upper jaw; and small, rounded ears. Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige. When it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pokémon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of Spheal have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pokémon lives in and around the sea. Spheal also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. Spheal are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo, which does so to check the former's health. When a Spheal finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey.

It evolves from Spheal starting at level 32 and evolves into Walrein starting at level 44. Sealeo is a bright-blue, pinniped Pokémon. Its throat and chest are beige with speckling around the edges. There are two short tusks protruding from its upper jaw, and it has dark brown, oval eyes. It has a powerful pair of front flippers, which are able to crush ice. Additionally, it has a short, flipper-like tail. On the sides of its blunt muzzle are thick, white whiskers. Sealeo's white whiskers are described as being super sensitive. When a Sealeo encounters new objects, they are placed on its nose and rolled around to test its smell and texture. The reason is to determine if it likes the object or not. It has also been known to roll Spheal or Poké Balls on its nose. The reason Sealeo does this to Spheal is to check its scent and ensure it is still healthy. This Pokémon lives in the sea and on drift ice. Sealeo dives underwater to hunt for prey five times a day. It searches for the prey by its scent. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Sealeo evolves from Spheal and evolves into Walrein.",90,60,70,75,70,45

It is primarily blue, with thin, white rings around its neck and lines on its fan-like tail-fin. There are two long, ivory tusks in its upper jaw. It has a round snout and yellow eyes, and large tufts of white fur about its face and neck. Its four short legs have long flippers instead of feet. Walrein lives in and around icy seas, where it is insulated against the cold by its thick layer of blubber. This layer of fat also protects it from enemy attacks by causing them to bounce off. While its long tusks are capable of crushing ice up to 10 tons in one blow, they may break during battle. Walrein's tusks grow continuously throughout its life, and any broken ones will grow back by the following year. The Hisui region is famous for the many broken tusks of Walrein that can be found there. This Pokémon can be found in herds of 20 to 30 individuals, which are fiercely protected by the leader. The leader is willing to give up its life in order to protect the herd. Prior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

It evolves into Huntail when traded while holding a Deep Sea Tooth or into Gorebyss when traded while holding a Deep Sea Scale. Clamperl is an aquatic bivalve Pokémon that makes its home on the seafloor. Its bivalve shell is dark blue with a silver rim along the inner edges. The shell is used to clamp down on prey, as well as for protection. A fully-grown shell will have nicks and scratches all over. Inside of the shell is a fragile, light blue body composed of six spherical extensions with a pink, pearl-like head in the center, usually depicted with its eyes closed. There is a circular white patch on each cheek. The pearls produced by this Pokémon amplify psychic power and can be blue in color as seen in the anime. Spoink's pearls come from Clamperl. These pearls are also 10 times more valuable than pearls produced by Shellder. It is carnivorous, clamping down on prey without letting go until it stops moving. When it is close to evolution, Clamperl will become too big to fit inside its shell. Clamperl is the only Pokémon that gains extra effects by holding a Deep Sea Tooth or Deep Sea Scale. Clamperl have been observed being carried by Drifblim, its natural predator. Clamperl evolves into either Huntail or Gorebyss.",35,64,85,74,55,32

Orange, semi-circular fins run the length of its spine, and there are two additional fins on the underside of its lower jaw. A large, fan-like fin projects from the top of its head. White spots that are surrounded by orange rings, resembling its eyes, dot its body. It attracts its prey by wagging its fish-shaped tail, which features glowing eye-spots, a single dorsal fin, and a single pectoral fin. Huntail's large mouth features sharp teeth and allows it to gulp its prey whole. Huntail swims by wiggling its body, though it is not the strongest swimmer. Its sturdy spine and large eyes allows it to survive in the high pressures and darkness of the deep sea. According to tradition, Huntail washing ashore is a sign that something unfortunate will happen. Huntail evolves from Clamperl and is one of its final forms, the other being Gorebyss.",55,104,105,94,75,52

It is one of Clamperl's final forms, the other being Huntail. Gorebyss is a pink, serpentine Pokémon with a long, thin mouth. This pointed mouth is used to stab prey and drain their body fluids. However, it has also been known to feed on seaweed that grows between stones. Its pink skin becomes brighter in the spring and after it has fed. Its body color changes with water temperature, with Gorebyss found in Alola having blindingly vivid coloration. A long, purple-tipped fin extends from the top of its head, and there is a thin, pointed fin extending beneath its head. There are two purple shells on its chest, causing it to somewhat resemble a mermaid. The tail has a purple, circular fin at the tip, and two white bands near its base. This Pokémon's body is durable enough to withstand high-pressure levels in the deep sea, where it lives. Additionally, this adaptation allows it to withstand powerful attacks.

#0369,Relicanth,Water, Rock,Swift, Rock,Sturdy,Water 1, Water 2,False,"Relicanth is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Relicanth is a Pokémon that is heavily based on the coelacanth. It is covered with hard, brown scales that are similar to craggy rocks. Its tan head has protruding cheekbones, which are smaller on a female. A triangular spike protrudes from the back of its head. Tan patches cover its body and there is a red spot located on both sides. It possesses two pairs of pectoral fins, which it uses to push itself along the sea bottom. Additionally, it has dorsal and pelvic fins near its tail. Its tail fin has a wavy outline. The composition of its scales, along with its fatty body and oil-filled swim bladders, allow it to withstand the intense pressure of the ocean depths. Relicanth once had teeth, but they have long since atrophied; as such, Relicanth is a filter feeder, feeding on microscopic organisms that it sucks up with its toothless mouth. It has remained unchanged for 100 million years and stays as such because it is already a perfect life-form. It was discovered during a deep-sea expedition. Relicanth's name comes from an explorer whose name served as a variation of it.",100,90,130,45,65,55

Luvdisc is a fishlike Pokémon with a relatively flat body in the shape of a heart. It is primarily light pink, with pale lips and circular markings on its cheeks. Its body is covered in heart-shaped scales. Luvdisc lives in shallow tropical warm seas, where it makes its nest in the branches of Corsola or coral reefs. During its breeding season, it forms groups that turn the ocean's surface bright pink. As shown in Luvdisc is a Many Splendored Thing!, when two Luvdisc kiss, they are able to use their slender bodies as wings in order to fly for short periods of time. If a Luvdisc is left alone, it becomes disheartened and open to attacks from predators, such as Pelipper. Luvdisc is seen as symbol of love and romance; loving couples gave this Pokémon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is said that any couple who sees a Luvdisc will be blessed with eternal love, thus honeymoon hotels usually release this Pokémon into their pools. A tradition in some places is to gift a Luvdisc to a person someone loves. At one point in the past, Luvdisc was overfished due to a rumor that its scales would allow one to find their sweetheart.",43,30,55,40,65,97
#0371,Bagon,Dragon,,Rock,,Sheer Force,Dragon,,False,"Bagon is a Dragon-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It evolves into Shelgon starting at level 30, which evolves into Salamence starting at level 50. Bagon is a bipedal, blue, reptilian Pokémon vaguely resembling a Pachycephalosaurus. It possesses a large, round snout, triangular eyes, yellow, circular ears similar to reptiles, and a yellow lower jaw with two teeth protruding upwards. Three thick, gray ridges cover the top of its head and continue downwards to cover its neck as well. There is a triangular patch of yellow on its underside. It has stubby, digit-less arms and short legs with two toes on each foot. Bagon lives in rough terrains with cliffs and rocks. It longs to fly and jumps off cliffs trying to be able to do so. Frustrated at its inability to fly, it leaps off cliffs and smashes its head against large rocks indiscriminately. This process of continually bashing its head causes it to become as hard as steel. Well-developed neck muscles support its hard head. This, combined with its powerful body, allows it to shatter rocks with its head. Bagon is known to be rather solitary, preferring not to form groups with others of its kind. It has been theorized that Bagon's habit of head-bashing and pure belief influences the cells needed to help it evolve. Bagon evolves into Shelgon, which evolves into Salamence.",45,75,60,40,30,50

It evolves from Bagon starting at level 30 and evolves into Salamence starting at level 50. Shelgon is a quadrupedal Pokémon that resembles a pupal stage. There are bone structures covering its body, which form a shell with two openings and three ridges on top. One opening is in front, revealing two yellow eyes, while the other opening is in the back. This bony covering repels enemy attacks, but it makes Shelgon heavy. Its gray legs are visible protruding from underneath the shell, each with a short red stripe on the inner surface. As a result, this Pokémon moves sluggishly and supposedly never eats or drinks, but it never seems to starve or thirst to death for reasons unknown. Inside the shell, its body is busy forming for its next evolution. It stores the necessary energy needed to evolve, and when it does, its shell begins to peel away. Shelgon can be found in caverns, where it stays still until it evolves. Shelgon evolves from Bagon and evolves into Salamence.",65,95,100,60,50,50
#0373,Salamence,Dragon, Flying,Intimidate,,Moxie,Dragon,,False,"Salamence is a dual-type Dragon/Flying pseudo-legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It evolves from Shelgon starting at level 50. It is the final form of Bagon. Salamence can Mega Evolve into Mega Salamence using the Salamencite. It is said to be a relative of the Paradox Pokémon Roaring Moon or a version of it from a different timeline. Salamence is a quadrupedal, draconic Pokémon with a long, tapering tail. It is primarily blue with a gray lower jaw and thickly scaled underside. There are red markings on its throat, the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its legs. Additionally, there are raised red ridges above its eyes. Three flat fins protrude from either side of its head, possibly acting in the same manner that a Canard would on an aircraft. It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws. Salamence is considered an unusual Pokémon due to the circumstances of its evolution; its fervent desire to fly triggered a cellular mutation that allowed it to suddenly grow large, red wings. Its long-held dream fulfilled at last, Salamence constantly flies around and releases intense blasts of fire as an expression of its joy. It only stops flying when it gets exhausted and needs to sleep. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out. It lives in rough terrain, and it competes with Garchomp midair for food. Salamence can Mega Evolve into Mega Salamence. As Mega Salamence, its wings meld together into a single huge, crescent-shaped wing. According to the anime, the hard, yet very flexible properties of its wings allow them to be used as blades in mid-air battles. Its face, neck, body and tail are narrower, and its tail is noticeably shorter in length. The ridges above its eyes are now far less prominent, and it no longer possesses the thick, gray scaling over its lower jaw. Instead, the smooth red flesh underneath has been left exposed, increasing its streamline appearance. The upper pair of fins resting on the sides of its head are now elongated and tapered. The lower pair has not changed much. However, the middle set now take the form of quarter-arches, spanning towards the bridge of the nose. The remnants of its shelled underbelly have been drastically transformed into a segmented, more aerodynamic, vest-like armored frame. This frame encases its chest and shoulders with the pieces interlocking whenever Mega Salamence tucks in its front forelegs. Roaring Moon bears a resemblance to Mega Salamence, though the potential connection between the two is unknown. The stress of Salamence's vaunted wings becoming misshapen in its Mega Evolution aggravates it to the point of rampaging. This fuels its already brutal nature and makes it likely to turn against the Trainer who raised it. Because of this, Mega Salamence is feared as ""the blood-soaked crescent"". Anything and anyone in Salamence's path gets sliced in two by its bladelike wings, posing no interruption to its flight. Salamence evolves from Shelgon and is the final form of Bagon.",95,135,80,110,80,100

It has one large, red eye in the center of its nearly spherical head, which is set into a ball-and-socket joint at its front end. A short crest projects from its body and extends over its head. Even though Beldum is mechanical, it still has emotions, the need to eat, and a way of reproducing. Beldum's body lacks blood, and is instead made of cells that are all magnets. It uses magnetism to move, communicate, and control its attacks. Beldum sometimes gathers in swarms, communicating with each other telepathically and magnetically and moving in sync. When enraged, it can cause nearby machines to break from its strong magnetism. Beldum can also use its magnetic force to rapidly pull in enemies and then use its sharp claws to harm them. Beldum is scarce in the wild, but it does tend to inhabit areas with rugged terrain. It anchors itself to a cliff using its hooks when it sleeps. Beldum evolves into Metang, which evolves into Metagross.",40,55,80,35,60,30
#0375,Metang,Steel, Psychic,Clear,,Light Metal,Mineral,,False,"Metang is a dual-type Steel/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It evolves from Beldum starting at level 20 and evolves into Metagross starting at level 45. Metang is a robotic Pokémon with teal, metallic skin. It has a disc-shaped body with a pair of flat, gray spikes on either side toward the rear. A jet cannot scratch Metang due to its strong body. There is a gray spike in the middle of its face, similar to a nose. A pair of red eyes reside in two holes in its metallic skin. While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint. Metang is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pokémon. This linkage allows Metang to generate a strong, psychokinetic power that is doubled. However, this does not increase its intellect. This Pokémon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph in search of prey. When Metang finds its prey, it uses its psychic power to stop it from escaping. Then it firmly grabs onto the prey with its claws, never letting go. Metang's claws are able to rip through steel. This Pokémon lives on rough terrains and harsh mountains. It pursues Nosepass, loving its magnetic minerals. Metang evolves from Beldum and evolves into Metagross.",60,75,100,55,80,50
#0376,Metagross,Steel, Psychic,Clear,,Light Metal,Mineral,,False,"Metagross is a dual-type Steel/Psychic pseudo-legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It evolves from Metang starting at level 45. It is the final form of Beldum. Metagross can Mega Evolve into Mega Metagross using the Metagrossite. Metagross is a massive, robotic Pokémon with a turquoise, disc-shaped body, and four legs. The main body appears to serve as both head and body, and this Pokémon's overall construction gives it the appearance of a mechanized arachnid. It uses its heavy body to pin down its prey before consuming them with its large mouth. A large, metallic cross is situated in the center of its face. On either side of the cross, a red eye peers out from a space in Metagross's metallic armor. Its four legs are joined to the main body by ball-and-socket joints. While the upper portion of the legs is relatively thin, they are considerably thicker below the knee. Each leg has three short claws on the end and a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the knee. The legs can be tucked in, allowing Metagross to float in the air. Metagross is the result of two Metang fusing together. This gives Metagross four brains in total, all connected by a complex network of neurons. Because of these complex connections and the number of brains, this Pokémon is capable of performing complex calculations and is more intelligent than a supercomputer. It is imbued with psychic powers and uses its intelligence to analyze its opponents during battle. Metagross uses its fantastic strength to pin down a victim using its four claws and body. This allows Metagross to use its large mouth and teeth to chew its victim to pieces. This Pokémon can be found on rough terrains. Metagross can also be found living in snowy mountains as their magnetic powers become stronger in freezing temperatures. Metagross can Mega Evolve into Mega Metagross. As Mega Metagross, it constantly floats, and its legs become arms. It also gains four legs on the back of its head. The cross on its face turns pale gold, and it gains two small holes and a spike immediately below the cross, giving the impression of a goatee. Mega Metagross achieves its form by linking up a Metagross, a Metang, and two Beldum together. Its multiple brains process information simultaneously, enabling it to calmly assess the tide of a battle and defeat its opponent with accuracy. Mega Metagross also uses the psychic power inside its body to launch powerful attacks. Its claws are hard as steel and can easily smash even large chunks of rocks. Because Mega Evolution stimulates its multiple brains and increases its intelligence, Mega Metagross becomes a ruthless combatant that will clutch at victory by absolutely any means, no matter how horrifyingly cruel. If victory is deemed impossible, Metagross will attempt to dig its claws into its opponent and prepare to explode. Metagross evolves from Metang and is the final form of Beldum.",80,135,130,95,90,70

It has a pattern of seven orange dots on its face that resembles a capital letter ""H"". It has long arms with jutting shoulders and club-like hands without fingers. There is a line of orange rocky spines running down its back, and its legs are short in comparison to its body. When it gets damaged in battle, it will search for new rocks to repair itself. Because of this, the rocks it is made of come from several different places around the world, which contributes to Regirock's patchwork appearance. Recently, cutting-edge technology has found that Regirock is entirely made of stone and rock, as it does not seem to have a heart or brain. According to legend, Regirock was created by Regigigas.

It has four spikes on its back and its two legs are conical and it balances its entire body on their points. There are three fingers on each of its pentagonal arms. As depicted in Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, Regice can move around by floating in the air. Regice cloaks itself in air that is −328 °F , and anything near Regice will become frozen. It can even survive when submerged in molten lava or other extremely hot temperatures. Regice is believed to have been created by Regigigas, and has slept in a glacier for thousands of years since an ice age.

Most of Registeel's body is spherical and gray while the middle of its face has the appearance of being exposed as it shows black ""skin"" and is surrounded by raised metal. Registeel's lower half is disc-like in shape and has two cylindrical legs without toes. Its face consists of seven red dots in a hexagonal formation, and it has black arms with three fingers each that are connected to its upper half by gray hemispherical shoulders. The backs of its hands have three red triangles pointing away from the fingers. While Registeel has been classified as a Steel-type Pokémon, its body is hollow and made of a material that is harder than any known metal. However, this material stretches and shrinks despite its hardness. While one Pokédex entry noted that the material that forms Registeel's body is extraterrestrial, it is also theorized that Registeel was actually born inside the Pokémon world's mantle, before emerging onto the surface 10,000 years ago. Further evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Registeel's body was tempered by pressure underground over thousands of years; as a result, it cannot be scratched. Another theory posits that Registeel was created by Regigigas out of magma. It is unknown what Registeel can eat. It was sealed away in ruins by people during ancient times.",80,75,150,75,150,50

Latias is a Pokémon with a birdlike body stylized after a plane. Its long neck stretches forward from its squat body. It has no legs, usually floating instead. The rear half of its body is largely red and the upper half white, with jet-plane wings high on its rear and fins on the bottom near its tail. A blue triangle marks the center of its chest, while a red mask partially covers its face. Ear-like fins sit on top of its head and its eyes are yellow. It has short, three-fingered arms with a red covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latias is a female-only species, with Latios being its male counterpart. Latias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its glass-like, downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It is highly intelligent and can understand human speech. It is capable of using telepathy to communicate with others. In the fifth movie, Latias had the ability ""Sight Sharing"", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. It normally does not make contact with humans or other Pokémon and disappears when an enemy is nearby. It forms herds with several members and is usually found near water. Latias loves Latias Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. Latias can be summoned by the Eon Flute. Latias is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Mist Ball.

While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Kyogre can undergo Primal Reversion and become Primal Kyogre if it holds the Blue Orb. Kyogre possesses the ability to expand the oceans. In ancient times, it came into conflict with Groudon, a Pokémon with the ability to expand continents. In Pokémon Sapphire, Emerald, and Alpha Sapphire, Kyogre is sought after by Team Aqua as part of their plot to create more habitats for aquatic Pokémon by raising the sea level. Kyogre is the game mascot of Pokémon Sapphire and its remake, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, with Kyogre appearing on the box art of Sapphire and Primal Kyogre appearing on the box art of Alpha Sapphire. Along with Groudon and Rayquaza, Kyogre is one of the super-ancient Pokémon. Kyogre is a massive, whale-like Pokémon with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails. It has a deep blue body and a white chin area with two small spikes protruding under it. Above each eye are two white, oval-shaped spots. Kyogre has red stripes around its chin, eyes, dorsal fins, and torso. These stripes glow when Kyogre is brimming with power. The tail is tattered with four trailing parts, with the inner ones being smaller than the outer. Its eyes are small, yellow, and shadowed with black. Kyogre is believed to be the personification of the sea itself, and is also described in mythology as the creator of the world's ocean. Kyogre is an immensely powerful Pokémon, having control over the water and being capable of creating a huge rain cloud that'd slowly spread out to the whole world, eventually drowning it completly. As Kyogre slumbers, it is incased in a layer of rock that'll be shattered away if it is awakened by the Blue Orb. It is said to have expanded the seas and is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it encounters its rival, Groudon, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. Said battle can only be stopped by the intervention of Rayquaza. Kyogre is able to fly when it has no water to swim in. Kyogre can attack its foes with countless beams of light that glow a deep and brilliant blue. Kyogre generally lives deep in the ocean and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre loves Kyogre Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. Kyogre is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Origin Pulse. Prior to Generation V, Drizzle was its signature Ability. Kyogre can undergo Primal Reversion and become Primal Kyogre. Primal Kyogre retains its general body structure but grows to more than double the size of its base form. Its main skin color becomes a darker shade of blue, the red markings along its body become light blue, and its eyes glow yellow with orange irises and orange-red pupils.

As Groudon slumbers, it is incased in a layer of rock that'll be shattered away if it is awakened by the Red Orb. Groudon was hailed as a savior for evaporating flooded areas of the world. Groudon is normally calm and helpful, but if it encounters its rival, Kyogre, Groudon will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. Said battle can only be stopped by the intervention of Rayquaza. Groudon can travel on water by using its magma to form a path beneath its feet. Groudon can attack its foes by manifesting the power of the land in fearsome blades of stone.

Jirachi hibernates for extensive periods, forming a protective crystalline shell as it sleeps. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep if it is in danger. It awakens for seven days every thousand years, but can also waken if sung to by a voice of purity. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, as depicted in Jirachi: Wish Maker, Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Jirachi's wishes are granted by writing on the three tags located on its head. Due to only having three tags, Jirachi can only grant three wishes. The anime further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation.

Blue and black fur cover most of its body. Its ears, face, hind paws, and front half of its body are blue, while its hindquarters are black. Additionally, Luxio has a tufty black mane surrounding its face. The mane is longer on the male Luxio, while the blue coloration on the hind paws extends to the ankles on the female. The insides of its rounded ears are yellow, as are its eyes. There are two yellow rings around each front leg and a yellow, four-point star on the tip of its tail. When facing an opponent, Luxio extends its claws in preparation, which can unleash 1,000,000 volts of electricity. Even a slight scratch from these claws is enough to cause fainting. Besides for attacking, Luxio also uses its claws to communicate with others of its kind, by resting them on the others' forelegs and sending electrical pulses through them. Luxio live in small groups and are able to generate powerful electricity by gathering the group's tails together. Luxio are known to be kind enough to share the spoils from a hunt to its own kind.

#0405,Luxray,Electric,,Rivalry, Intimidate,Guts,Field,,False,"Luxray is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Luxio starting at level 30. It is the final form of Shinx. Luxray is a quadrupedal Pokémon resembling a fully-grown lion. While its face, hind legs, torso, and the back of its front legs are blue, much of its body is covered with shaggy, black fur. The fur is longer around the shoulders and the base of the tail, and forms a mane on its head. The mane is larger on the male than on the female. It has yellow eyes with red sclerae, a blunt muzzle, and rounded ears with yellow insides. The eyes change to the color when when using its ability. There are three yellow half-rings on the back of each foreleg. Its long, thin tail is tipped with a yellow four-pointed star. Luxray has powerful eyesight that is capable of seeing through most objects, like X-ray vision. It uses this ability for hunting and keeping track of its offspring. However, this ability requires a lot of electricity to use. As a result, Luxray needs to sleep for long periods of time in order to store up more energy. Luxray live in packs, each having one male to lead them. Luxray evolves from Luxio and is the final form of Shinx.",80,120,79,95,79,70
#0406,Budew,Grass, Poison,Natural, Poison,Leaf Guard,No Eggs Discovered,,False,"Budew is a dual-type Grass/Poison baby Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves into Roselia when leveled up with high friendship during the day, which evolves into Roserade when exposed to a Shiny Stone. Budew is a bipedal, rosebud-like Pokémon. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon. Its face is yellow with small, slit-like eyes. It appears to be wearing a green bib and has triangular, stubby yellow feet. When the two vines that are on top of its head open up, a big spot can be seen on each. One vine has a blue spot, while the other has a red spot. Budew keeps its buds closed during the cold winter, but opens them again in the spring and releases poisonous pollen. The pollen it scatters induces harsh sneezing and runny noses, and is more toxic depending on how clean the water it was fed with was. Budew's bud beginning to open is seen as the imminent arrival of spring. It lives near clean pools and ponds.",40,30,35,50,70,55

It evolves from Roselia when exposed to a Shiny Stone. It is the final form of Budew. Roserade is a bipedal Pokémon with an appearance that incorporates features of roses and masquerade attire. It has hair made of white rose petals, and a leafy, green cape with a yellow, collar-like bangle on its neck. The cape pattern reaches toward the back of its head, in spiky, sepal-like extensions on the hair. A male will have a shorter cape than a female. It has a dark-green mask over its red, yellow-lidded eyes. The lower portion of its face is light green, and it holds a bouquet in each hand, with a red in its right hand and blue in its left. Its limbs and underside are light green. Its feet end with yellow tips. Roserade lures prey with a sweet aroma. The more toxic its poison, the sweeter its aroma becomes. Each hand has different toxins, but both hands can jab with near-deadly power. Roserade's right arm contains poisons that act faster, while its left arm contains poisons that act slower. Regardless, Roserade's poison can be life-threatening. It attacks with a dancer-like elegance and uses hidden whips covered with poisonous thorns.

#0408,Cranidos,Rock,,Mold,,Sheer Force,Monster,,False,"Cranidos is a Rock-type Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is resurrected from a Skull Fossil and evolves into Rampardos starting at level 30. Cranidos is a gray, dinosaur-like Pokémon resembling the Pachycephalosaurus. It has a hooked beak, red irises, and a hard, blue, dome-shaped head with four spikes on its back. The hard skull is considered to be Cranidos's most distinguishing feature. It has stubby arms with three claws; despite the stubbiness, it can attack with them. The back half of its body has a large, spiky pattern of blue and it has a short tail. It has feet with three forward claws and one backward. Its main attacking prowess involves charging head-first into its opponents. When it lived in dense forests and jungles 100 million years ago, it would use headbutts to snap obstructing trees, down its prey, and combat Pokémon like Aerodactyl and even other Cranidos. The resulting sound of two Cranidos headbutting echoes throughout the area like the sound of the pealing of a bell. It notably lacks any intelligence. Cranidos are considered to be a rare sight to encounter. The fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two are also often found near the fossilized rock layers of Cranidos fossils. It was brought back to life through Skull Fossil. In modern times, Cranidos can be found at the Canyon Biome located at the Terarium. Cranidos evolves into Rampardos.",67,125,40,30,30,58
#0409,Rampardos,Rock,,Mold,,Sheer Force,Monster,,False,"Rampardos is a Rock-type Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Cranidos starting at level 30, after it is revived from a Skull Fossil. Rampardos is a large, dark-gray, dinosaur-like Pokémon resembling a Pachycephalosaurus. It has a pearl-like dome crowning its head, which obstructs its red eyes. It has blue stripes, one on its tail, and one on each of its knees and wrists. It has various spikes: one on each knee, two on the blue-collar on its neck, two short ones on its nose, and four on its head. Two of these head spikes are bigger than the other two. Its strength lies within its fierce head-butting attacks. A charging Rampardos can knock down virtually anything with one hit. 100 million years ago, it lived in jungles, where it ruthlessly chased its prey while tearing down trees in its path. Rampardos has the personality of a brute. It enjoys barging into objects with its head to train its strength and reflexes. This resulted in its skull growing a foot thick and harder than steel, which prevents it from fainting if it crashes into anything, even another charging Rampardos. Long after its passing, ancient people would dig up its well-developed skull fossil and use it as a helmet. However, because its skull grew so thick, its brain became even smaller than that of Cranidos, leading to theories that its stupidity led to its extinction. Its fossils have been found near those of Bastiodon, suggesting that these two lived in the same habitat, likely as enemies. Very little was known about Rampardos's biology in ancient times. There were records of a Rampardos that escaped after being revived and evolved, destroying a skyscraper in the process. Rampardos evolves from Cranidos.",97,165,60,65,50,58
#0410,Shieldon,Rock, Steel,Sturdy,,Soundproof,Monster,,False,"Shieldon is a dual-type Rock/Steel Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is resurrected from an Armor Fossil and evolves into Bastiodon starting at level 30. Shieldon is a small, yellow, ceratopsian-like reptilian Pokémon. It has white toes and a white bump on its back. Shieldon has a dark-gray elliptical face, with a prominent white brow and a white rim on its black snout. Its facial hide is extremely hard; however, it is vulnerable when attacked from behind. 100 million years ago, Shieldon lived in dense forests and primeval jungles. It has a habit of polishing its face against tree trunks. It is speculated that few enemies would have considered challenging its armored face. It eats grass, tree roots, and Berries. Its fossils show no sign of damage to its face. Shieldon is described as having a mild-mannered nature and dislikes conflict. Shieldon was revived from a Armor Fossil. In modern times, it can be found living a the Canyon Biome located in the Terarium Shieldon evolves into Bastiodon.",30,42,118,42,88,30
#0411,Bastiodon,Rock, Steel,Sturdy,,Soundproof,Monster,,False,"Bastiodon is a dual-type Rock/Steel Fossil Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Shieldon starting at level 30, after it is revived from an Armor Fossil. Bastiodon is a Pokémon which appears to be a cross between a ceratopsian such as Chasmosaurus and a bulldozer. Its dark gray, square head resembles a castle wall, complete with four cream-yellow, window-like spots with a black outline, three dark gray spikes on the top, and two larger gray spikes in the upper corners. Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail. It is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pokémon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. It seems to have lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils often being found together. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same environment as the Rampardos. Often, the duo's fossils have been found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death. Bastiodon evolves from Shieldon.",60,52,168,47,138,30
#0412,Burmy,Bug,,Shed,,Overcoat,Bug,,False,"Burmy is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves into either Wormadam or Mothim starting at level 20 depending on its gender; female Burmy evolve into Wormadam, whereas male Burmy evolve into Mothim. Burmy has three forms: Plant Cloak, Sandy Cloak, and Trash Cloak . It changes its cloak based on the environment of its last battle. In the case of female Burmy, its form determines the form of Wormadam it evolves into, which is permanent. The specifics of how an environment affects Burmy's cloak vary between games. The cloak only affects the form of Wormadam it evolves into, otherwise having no effect on gameplay.",40,29,45,29,45,36
#0413,Wormadam,Bug, Grass,Anticipation,,Overcoat,Bug,,False,"Wormadam is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from a female Burmy starting at level 20. It is one of Burmy's final forms, the other being Mothim. It has one of three different secondary types: Steel, Grass, or Ground, determined by its cloak. Its cloak is permanent and determined by the cloak that Burmy was in when it evolved. Wormadam is a black, bagworm-like Pokémon with a coat of plants, sand, or garbage, the last of which resembles building insulation. It has oval eyes, a long pointed beak, and a long antenna with a coiled tip. The beak is tipped with varying colors depending on the coat. The coat forms a pair of arm-like structures near this Pokémon's head. It is a female-only species, with Mothim as its male counterpart. Wormadam has three separate forms: Plant Cloak, Sandy Cloak, and Trash Cloak. The Plant Cloak form has several white flowers covering it and gives Wormadam a green-tipped beak and large leaves for arms. It will be dotted with reddish-brown rocks, and have chains of pebbles for arms and a brown tipped beak if it has the Sandy Cloak. When covered by the Trash Cloak, it has a pink-tipped beak and long, dark pink ribbons for arms. Wormadam that evolve on cold days are said to form thicker cloaks. Unlike Burmy, Wormadam's cloak is a part of its body, with the fusion being suspected to have been caused by the energy generated by its evolution. Its cloak acts similar to fur and skin and never sheds. Sandy Cloak Wormadam's cloak is an effective defense, capable of repelling a Starly's pecking with ease, whereas Trash Cloak Wormadam uses its cloak as camouflage, as it helps it hide from predators. Wormadam evolves from female Burmy and is one of the final forms of the species, the other being Mothim. Its cloak is permanent and determined by the cloak that Burmy was in when it evolved.

#0414,Mothim,Bug, Flying,Swarm,,Tinted Lens,Bug,,False,"Mothim is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from a male Burmy starting at level 20. It is one of Burmy's final forms, the other being Wormadam. Mothim is a moth-like Pokémon with two pairs of wings, one pair larger than the other is. The wings are primarily tan with an orange, oval marking on each. The tips of the wings split into small, orange squares; there are three on the larger pair and two on the smaller pair. Mothim spreads steel-colored scales whenever it flaps its wings. Mothim's head has orange semi-circular eyes with gray, orange-tipped antennae running along the edges before extending and widening at the top. Its body is black with a patch of orange on the underside and a gray stripe down its back. It also has four gray legs and a small black tail that splits into two squares. Mothim is a nomadic, nocturnal Pokémon that always remains on the move, searching for flower honey and nectar. It has often been seen traveling in fields and mountains. Despite its diet, Mothim is never seen near any flower gardens. This is because, instead of gathering honey on its own, Mothim raids the hives of Combee for honey. It is a male-only species, with Wormadam as its female counterpart. Mothim evolves from male Burmy and is one of the final forms of the species, the other being Wormadam.",70,94,50,94,50,66
#0415,Combee,Bug, Flying,Honey,,Hustle,Bug,,False,"Combee is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. Female Combee evolve into Vespiquen starting at level 21. Male Combee are not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Combee is a small, flying, insectoid Pokémon. Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area. Similar to other Pokémon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth. Unlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred to a thousand individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected. Prior to Generation V, Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability. Female Combee evolve into Vespiquen. Male Combee are not known to evolve.",30,30,42,30,42,70
#0416,Vespiquen,Bug, Flying,Pressure,,Unnerve,Bug,,False,"Vespiquen is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from a female Combee starting at level 21. Male Combee are not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Vespiquen is a bee-like Pokémon with a typical insect-like, three-part body, i.e. divided into an abdomen, thorax, and head. It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the ‘gown’ part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion. Similar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward. Vespiquen is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order. Vespiquen evolve from female Combee.",70,80,102,80,102,40
#0417,Pachirisu,Electric,,Run, Pickup,Volt Absorb,Field, Fairy,False,"Pachirisu is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Along with Starly and Munchlax, Pachirisu is one of the three Partner Pokémon of Almia available at the beginning of Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. Pachirisu is a small, white squirrel-like Pokémon with a faint blueish tint and a light blue stripe starting from its forehead and goes all the way down to the tip of the tail. A female Pachirisu's blue stripe is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth. It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pokémon. It is related to the Pikachu line. When it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods—which mainly consist of berries—in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pokémon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static. It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored electricity. It is generally found in treetops in forests, as well as the outskirts of a forest and near power plants.",60,45,70,45,90,95
#0418,Buizel,Water,,Swift,,Water Veil,Water 1, Field,False,"Buizel is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves into Floatzel starting at level 26. Buizel is an orange Pokémon resembling a weasel and a sea otter. It has a yellow collar around its neck and two blue fins on its arms. Buizel has a cream-colored spot above each eye and two black parallel marks on its cheeks. The underside of its face and stomach are also cream-colored, as are the tips of its two tails. A male Buizel has two cream-colored spots on their back, while a female has only one. Buizel's yellow collar is a flotation sac that can be inflated when it inhales. By doing so, Buizel can keep its face above water to watch for prey movement or survey its surroundings. Conversely, it deflates this sac in order to dive. Its tails can spin to act as a propeller, allowing it to swim and slice through obstacles like seaweed. In the anime, it is also able to fly using its spinning tail. Buizel usually lives alongside bodies of water. Buizel evolves into Floatzel.",55,65,35,60,30,85
#0419,Floatzel,Water,,Swift,,Water Veil,Water 1, Field,False,"Floatzel is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Buizel starting at level 26. Floatzel is an orange Pokémon resembling an anthropomorphic otter or weasel with longer arms than legs. It has four fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot. Its feet are small in comparison to the rest of the body. It has two pointed blue fins on its arms; two aligned, backward-swept, pointed fins on its head; and two tails, which can spin like a propeller in a similar way to its pre-evolution's. It has cream colorations on its forehead, eyelids, muzzle, belly, and the tips of its forelimbs and tails. It also has one cream, slightly protruding, oval-shaped spot on its back if it is female, and two of these spots if it is male. There is an orange teardrop shape near the bottom of its belly, and a pattern of two black triangles on the edges of its muzzle. It has small, sharp canine teeth, the top two of which can be seen when its mouth is closed. Floatzel has a yellow flotation sac, which seems to behave similar to rubber. The flotation sac goes in a kind of ring behind its head, down in front of its arms, then back behind its rear above the tails. Floatzel's sac developed as a result of chasing prey in the water. To help it dive, Floatzel can deflate its flotation sac, and then inflate it once again when it wishes to surface. Floatzel's sac allows it to not drown, even in stormy seas. Along with hunting for food, Floatzel can use its swimming capabilities to assist in the rescues of drowning people, by carrying them like a raft. It is often seen near fishing hamlets. Floatzel evolves from Buizel.",85,105,55,85,50,115
#0420,Cherubi,Grass,,Chlorophyll,,,Fairy, Grass,False,"Cherubi is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves into Cherrim starting at level 25. Cherubi is a small, cherry-like Pokémon with a round, deep-pink body with two stubby feet. The body becomes redder when bathed in sunlight, which signals that it has stockpiled a lot of nutrients. It has beady eyes and a purple-red stripe running down part of its face. Cherubi has a short stem with two big, green leaves and a second, much smaller head growing out of it. This second head is vestigial in terms of function, but it contains nutrients that contribute to Cherubi's growth as its initial source of food. The second head is apparently edible and has a sweet taste, and several Pokémon such as Starly have been seen trying to pluck it off. When the second head begins to bloom and wilt, it means Cherubi is close to evolving. The second head detaches after Cherubi evolves, which become food for other creatures. Cherubi is attracted to honey. Cherubi evolves into Cherrim.",45,35,45,62,53,35
#0421,Cherrim,Grass,,Flower,,,Fairy, Grass,False,"Cherrim is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Cherubi starting at level 25. In sunny weather, Cherrim changes appearance from its Overcast Form into its Sunshine Form. Cherrim is a small Pokémon with two different forms, both of which are dependent on the weather. During normal weather conditions, Cherrim is in its Overcast Form. Two purple petals enclose its deep pink body. A short purple stem and a green leafy sepal sprout from the top of the petals. Its eyes appear to be near its short legs in this form. Cherrim waits quietly as a bud for a ray of sunlight. When it is hit with strong sunlight, it blooms and absorbs the rays with its entire body. It quickly changes from quiet to excitable and active. It will attempt to make up for everything it was forced to endure as a bud while the sunlight lasts. Once the light is gone, Cherrim folds back into a bud. Bug Pokémon are often seen gathering around Cherrim due to being drawn in by the scent released from its petals. Cherrim is the only known Pokémon that can have Flower Gift as an Ability. Cherrim has two forms: Overcast Form and Sunshine Form. When there is strong sunlight, Cherrim changes into its Sunshine Form. Pink petals similar to cherry blossoms surround its head and cover its chest. Several of the petals radiate outward from a yellow sphere on the back of its head. There is a small, triangular patch of green on its neck. Additionally, two berry-like orbs, resembling cherry-shaped hair ornaments, adorn its head. It has stubby limbs, with the arms being pink and the legs being yellow.

#0422,Shellos,Water,,Sticky, Storm,Sand Force,Water 1, Amorphous,False,"Shellos is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves into Gastrodon starting at level 30. Shellos has two different forms: West Sea Shellos, which is pink and white in appearance, and East Sea Shellos, which is blue and green. They are found on the respective sides of Sinnoh's mountain range. Shellos is a sea slug-like Pokémon whose appearance changes depending on which part of the sea it is found in. Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot. The West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters. The East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters. Shellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the anime, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well. This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokémon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before. Shellos has two separate forms: West Sea Shellos and East Sea Shellos. The two forms differ in appearance only. Shellos evolves into Gastrodon. West Sea East Sea",76,48,48,57,62,34

They are found on the respective sides of Sinnoh's mountain range. Gastrodon is a sea slug-like Pokémon. Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a mantle covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos, Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in. In its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs. In its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear. Gastrodon and its pre-evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate. Gastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late. Gastrodon has two separate forms: West Sea Gastrodon and East Sea Gastrodon. The two forms are purely cosmetic, and do not affect base stats or level-up moves. Gastrodon evolves from Shellos.

The bases of Ambipom's tails also have a similar frill. It has round ears with red insides. Ambipom has an arrangement of split hair sticking out from the top of its head. These strands of hair are longer on a female. It has a purple, triangular nose and wide eyes. Ambipom can leap from tree to tree with brilliant speed. To eat, it deftly shucks nuts with its two tails. As it has two hands on its tails, it rarely uses its arms. Ambipom can use their tails to communicate with other Ambipom. Ambipom works in large colonies in heavily wooded areas and makes rings by linking tails with another Ambipom, apparently in friendship. Ambipom has been seen giving rings even to humans sometimes. It also shows affection by using both of its tails to wrap and squeeze people. It lives along with its young, Aipom. It lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tails for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In the Alola region, while searching for comfortable trees, Ambipom tends to get into territorial disputes with Passimian, in which they win half the time.

At the base of its body is a frayed protrusion that resembles the tied end of a balloon. In the middle of its face is a yellow tape-like ""X"" mark, which contains its little mouth in the very center. Located on either side of the ""X"" are its small, black eyes. A white mass of fluff that resembles a cloud sits on top of Drifloon's head. Drifloon's body is filled with air, as well as the lost spirits of people and Pokémon. Its body expands as it collects more souls. If it explodes, the souls unleash with a screaming sound. It is also rumored that Drifloon itself is reincarnated from deceased humans. This Pokémon is known as a ""Signpost for Wandering Spirits"" due to its aimless drifting. Desiring company, Drifloon often seeks out children and grabs their hands. However, due to how light it is, it can be resisted easily and is often pulled around. This results in Drifloon running away from any children who are rough with it. Drifloon also dislikes heavy children. There are rumors that Drifloon steals children who hold onto it, guiding them to the afterlife. Despite this reputation, as seen in the anime, Drifloon can be friendly and helpful. In the movies, Drifloon's body puffs up when they get angry or aggressive. Drifloon sightings are typically more common at night. It prefers to reside in damp, humid locations and can expand or shrink to express its feelings. Drifloon and its evolved form, Drifblim, are the only known Pokémon that can have Flare Boost as an Ability. Prior to Generation V, this was also true for Unburden.

The colors are separated by a repeated semicircle pattern all around its body. On the top of its head is a puffy, white mass, which closely resembles a cloud. In the center of its body is a large yellow ""X"" mark, and on either side just above the ""X"" are its small, red eyes. On the lower portion of its body are four long, thin arms that extend diagonally in four different directions. Its arms are tipped with yellow and have three short points each. The bottom of its body narrows into a short, red extrusion that fans slightly outward. Drifblim's body contains souls, said to be burdened with regrets. These souls serve as fuel for Drifblim's gas. Drifblim is strong enough to lift Pokémon or people but has no control over its flight. This causes it to drift with the wind and end up anywhere. It can, however, inflate and deflate itself with gas to control its altitude. It is rarely active during the day but usually gathers in groups during the evenings. When noticed, the groups will suddenly vanish to unknown locations. Drifblim preys on Clamperl. There are rumors of Drifblim carrying people to the afterlife; as well, there have been songs or poems dedicated to Drifblim due to people admiring its transient, melancholy aspect.

Buneary is a small, bipedal, rabbit-like Pokémon with brown ears that can curl up. It has two types of fur covering its body: a light tan fleece that covers much of its lower body, feet, and the tips of its ears, and a smooth, chocolate-colored pelt on the upper half of its body. It has a small, triangular pink nose, pink paw pads on the undersides of its feet, and small tan spots above its eyes. It has a small brown puff of a tail. Buneary almost always keeps one of its ears rolled up. Although Professor Laventon had hypothesized that this is done to protect its hearing, in actuality, Buneary rolls its ears so it can quickly unroll them and launch them as an attack. The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders and increases in power as Buneary trains to use it. Buneary can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. Buneary's arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If Buneary senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if Buneary rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, Buneary sleeps with its head tucked into its fur. It lives in forests, though it can also be found on icy mountains. Prior to Generation V, Buneary and its evolved form, Lopunny, were the only known Pokémon that could have Klutz as an Ability.

It has pink eyes with black markings on the inner edge, long tufts of cream-colored fur above its eyes, and a small, pink nose. Similar tufts of fluffy cream-colored fur cover its wrists, lower legs, and the ends of its long ears, which bend shortly above its head. Lopunny is very proud of these ears and never fails to groom them. If the ears are roughly handled, Lopunny will kick in retaliation. Lopunny's fur is warm and light, and Lopunny sheds it twice a year. Its winter coat is soft and fluffy, and filled with plenty of insulating air. This fur can be used to make warm mufflers and hats. Lopunny is a timid Pokémon that constantly monitors its surroundings, and will cloak its body with its ears or spring away when it senses danger. Despite this, it is capable of unleashing superdestructive kicks with its lithe legs. Lopunny's kicks are said to be similar to those of karate masters, which allows it to drive back foes with no issues. Prior to Generation V, Lopunny and its pre-evolved form, Buneary, were the only known Pokémon that could have Klutz as an Ability. Lopunny can Mega Evolve into Mega Lopunny. As Mega Lopunny, its personality drastically changes, becoming extremely aggressive with wild fighting instincts. In order to become more capable of fighting, it sheds the fur on its neck, upper torso, fingers, and legs, forming black patterns on the legs that resemble ripped pantyhose. The tufts of fur above its eyes combine to form a single butterfly-shaped crest. The cream fur on its wrists and ankles becomes more round instead of fluffy. Its ear fur now only covers two segments of each ear in fluffy bands. When Mega Evolved, a full-power whip swing from its ears can crumple steel plates.

It has a thin, red mouth that resembles the letter ""W."" Below its head, Mismagius has a short, thorax-like lump from which its body connects. Three elliptical red spheres surround the upper portion of Mismagius's body. There are extensions on the sides of its lower body with the foremost ones tattered compared to rear ones. This gives Mismagius the appearance of wearing some kind of cloak. Mismagius usually shows up without warning to cause havoc on unsuspecting humans or Pokémon. If it is powerful, Mismagius can use advanced incantations for various purposes, such as causing misery or happiness. Due to this, people often seek to capture Mismagius as if their life depends on it, solely to make someone fall in love with them. There is a custom on inviting Mismagius to one's home, usually to ward off misfortune with its spells. However, this can also lead to disaster should Mismagius ever be provoked. People that hear its cries will usually receive headaches and hallucinations. As shown in the anime, Mismagius can put its victims to sleep, and cause them to enter a strange dream world without their noticing. If Mismagius falls asleep or is knocked out, the victim will wake up. It can sometimes be found roaming around lakes and mountainsides at night.

The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving Honchkrow the moniker, ""Summoner of Night."" Honchkrow will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so.

The frilly portion of its spiraling tail is forked, but it usually keeps it clasped around its waist, which makes it appear less fat. Despite appearing very sluggish, Purugly will not be reluctant to attack if angered and can be quite fast. Purugly attempts to make itself look larger and more intimidating by cinching its waist with its forked tail. It barges into the nests of other Pokémon and frightens them off so Purugly can claim the nest as its own. It does this by glaring with its eyes ceaselessly. It can be found in both urban areas and heavily wooded forests. Despite its disrespectful and scary nature, Purugly is rather popular.

As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases. It can remain in the same spot for a long time. It also has a habit of crying, not because it is sad or needing attention, but rather it is due to excess moisture in its body. As it cries, it expels both sweat and tears from its eyes; Bonsly sweat tastes a little salty, while the tears are slightly bitter. It dies if it gets too damp with this moisture. This habit also gets enemies to let their guards down. It prefers dry, rock-strewn areas, but it isn't uncommon to see one in a garden.

#0442,Spiritomb,Ghost, Dark,Pressure,,Infiltrator,Amorphous,,False,"Spiritomb is a dual-type Ghost/Dark Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Spiritomb is a ghostly purple Pokémon attached to a stone. Although lacking a physical body, Spiritomb projects its appearance out of a small rock called the Odd Keystone. The rock is trapezoidal in shape and has two small dots. There is a fissure running down the middle, splitting in two near the bottom. The crack in combination with the two dots appears to form a frowning face. Spiritomb's projected appearance is an ethereal composition of swirling purple energy of an unknown kind. Its face is set in the middle of the purple, and contains green, crescent eyes that are connected to its jagged mouth. Its pupils are composed of a spiral and it is sometimes only seen with one. Swirling around its face are green orbs with yellow centers. Spiritomb is formed by a collection of 108 spirits, some of which are ill-natured. This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell. Several Pokédex entries state that Spiritomb was sealed roughly 500 years before the present time. The Pokémon lays curses with its wicked thoughts. It will lash out at anyone with little thought, often exercising short-sightedness in its pursuit of vengeance. It is rarely encountered in the wild. In most media, Spiritomb moves its body primarily through telepathy and the ability to float; though in the core series games, it can only appear to do so through dragging the Odd Keystone across the ground. Spiritomb is able to control and interact through the Odd Keystone without manifesting its ghostly appearance, seemingly able to emit an eerie presence in the absence of a Keystone; as found in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire at Sea Mauville. It will stalk the player upon entering a specific room on the ship with the message ""It feels as though you’re being watched..."", appearing behind the player and battling them through the Odd Keystone the moment the screen fades from black, provided the player is in the very top left of the room. Papers in the room state that it was donated from the Oreburgh Mine, suggesting that several Odd Keystones meant to contain Spiritomb can be found in the Underground of Sinnoh. Professor Cozmo's father, Raizoh, was responsible for misplacing it when working on the ship. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Spiritomb's 108 spirits appear in the form of Wisps, small purple entities scattered across the Hisui region after a seal was broken. When 107 Wisps have been taken to a large Odd Keystone shrine at the Crimson Mirelands' Shrouded Ruins as per Vessa's request, she will provide the player with the final Wisp and disappear, where a wild Spiritomb will appear. This may imply that Spiritomb, have the power to directly affect or possess those in the world of the living. On the occasion that a wild Spiritomb is found as an Alpha Pokémon through a Massive Mass Outbreak in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, its eyes on both its actual face, as well as the entire ""face"" within the Odd Keystone will glow a deep red. As depicted in The Keystone Pops!, Spiritomb can be just as aggressive and destructive as the spirits that it is composed of. The Spectral Express! also revealed that anyone possessed by one of Spiritomb's spirits will start to cause misdeeds, and their face will eventually start to resemble Spiritomb. Losing one of these spirits will cause Spiritomb to go on an uncontrollable rampage until the lost spirit is returned.",50,92,108,92,108,35

It has also been seen huddling with other members of its species to stave off the cold, although it enjoys play-fighting with them as well. Gible is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains. Gible has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest. However, even while biting, it often hurts itself because of clumsiness. This sometimes causes its teeth to chip and fall off in the process, but Gible is never bothered by this because the teeth will grow back after a few days. As shown in the anime, Gible is capable of eating through most types of metal. Gible evolves into Gabite, which evolves into Garchomp.",58,70,45,40,45,42

The protrusions on Gabite's head allows it to emit ultrasound waves, which can be used for navigating through pitch-dark caves. Gabite is also a very territorial creature and will fight back against enemies to protect its home. Gabite is passionate about shiny objects, such as gems, treasures, and even Carbink, and it hoards a collection of them in its nest. When it sees Sableye trying to take Carbink as food, Gabite jealously attacks the Sableye. Despite its aggressive demeanor, giving Gabite a sparkly item such as a glass bead can turn it docile. It predominantly lives in mountainous regions, and can survive in both snowy and arid temperatures. Gabite evolves from Gible and evolves into Garchomp.",68,90,65,50,55,82

A patch of gold comes to a point below the red on its belly, and a golden star shape adorns the tip of its snout. Garchomp has horn-like appendages that resemble a jet or plane's engines, giving it an appearance similar to a hammerhead shark. These horns allow it to sense its prey from a long distance. Its large mouth features razor-sharp teeth. The feet have three white talons, and each arm has a single large, white claw for a hand. Curved fins sprout from the arms, creating wings that allow Garchomp to fly. Garchomp also has a large dorsal fin and another on its tail that resembles a shark tailfin. The male's dorsal fin has a notch on it. Pairs of small, white spikes protrude from its upper arms and legs, and there are gill-like slits on the sides of the neck. The eyes are intense, with black sclerae and gold-colored irises. Garchomp can fly at an incredible speed to catch its prey, being capable of flying as fast as a jet, cutting down trees with its blades of wind, a magnificent sight to witness. It is able to move in both the air and underground. It preys on bird Pokémon and is known to eat entire flocks of them whole. It sometimes battles Salamence in the air as they compete for food. After catching prey, it returns to its den before its body can cool down. The fine scales on its body reduce drag for easier flight, and their sharp edges also serve to injure opponents who attack it directly. It can use its protuberances as sensors for finding distinct prey. Garchomp lives in mountainous regions, both volcanic and boreal, and typically dwells underground. However, it is seldom sighted in the wild. Garchomp is described as having a feral nature, requiring extreme caution should anyone encounter it. Garchomp can Mega Evolve into Mega Garchomp. When Garchomp Mega Evolves, several of its features become more angular, including its head and shoulders. A row of five tooth-like spikes sprouts from each side of its abdomen and red spikes grow from its knees. The claws and fins on its arms melt from the excessive Mega Evolution energy and morph together to form sharp, red blades. Because Garchomp takes great pride in its winglike fins, it is enraged at the sight of them melting into scythes. Its scythes can slice the ground to pieces, and Mega Garchomp viciously tears up its opponents with them. Garchomp evolves from Gabite and is the final form of Gible.",108,130,95,80,85,102

Darkrai is known to ""inhabit"" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Feather from Cresselia. However, the ""unleashing of nightmares"" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. Darkrai is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech. In The Rise of Darkrai, it was shown its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia.

#0493,Arceus,Normal,,Multitype,,,,,False,"Arceus is a Normal-type Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Arceus will change type and form when it is holding a Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal. Like Darkrai and Shaymin before it, Arceus was not officially recognized by Nintendo until February 14, 2009, the year of its debut movie. It was officially revealed to international audiences on August 3, 2009. Arceus is known as ""The Original One"", as it is said that it created Sinnoh and Ransei, and possibly the entire Pokémon universe, along with the lake guardians, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, as well as the Pokémon of Myth: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Arceus is featured prominently in Pokémon Legends: Arceus and plays a major role in its plot. Arceus is a white, equine Pokémon with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a qilin or centaur with a gray, vertically-striated underside. The striated pattern has similar recurrences on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes and red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head and ears that point upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen, which changes color along with its eyes and hooves based on its current type, which depends on the Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal that it wields. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly resumes past Arceus's waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is fairly like its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight. According to legend, it shaped the Pokémon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as ""The Original One"" in myths and legends and is generally considered to be one of the strongest Pokémon. Arceus is thought to have created Sinnoh and Ransei, and possibly the entire Pokémon universe, along with the lake guardians, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, as well as the Pokémon of Myth, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the most long-lived of all Pokémon species. It has the power to recreate the Pokémon of Myth as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, Arceus has been portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. As depicted in Showdown at the Gates of Warp!, Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia but also destroy the Red Chain. Arceus can change its type at will in order to adapt to a situation, as seen with its use of Plates or Z-Crystals. Arceus also has the power to split up into two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its home dimension which is also implied to be its physical form, being only a piece of its whole being, while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible. Arceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. In the modern time, Arceus continues to watch over the world, and it wishes for people and Pokémon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it would only give out hints for how to solve the problem, instead of directly interfering. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it is explained that Arceus can give its blessing to Pokémon to make them more powerful, which are referred to as noble Pokémon and Ride Pokémon, and the power is passed down through family lines. The people of Hisui worshipped the noble Pokémon. Arceus can also create items for humans to use, such as the Arc Phone. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends.

Because its crystals are valuable, with a fragment being capable of powering a hundred dump trucks, Boldore is targeted for them. It searches for underground water in the caves where it lives; however, because it is uncomfortable around water, it is always very careful about lapping it up. A healthy Boldore will always have its core sticking out.

It drapes the leaves over itself and draws them closed around its body, so only a large, crescent slit remains for its face to appear. This leafy cloak keeps the Pokémon warm. Under its cloak are darker green, limp leaves that frame the sides of Swadloon's face and trail down on the sides of its body. The top of the cloak has two semicircular leaves that form a V shape. These two head leaves allow Swadloon to detect air movements and feel the surrounding area. On its back are the veins of the leaf as well as a bit at the bottom tip of the cloak resembling a rounded tail.

Its head is tipped with three oblong leaves, whose color can determine how healthy the Petilil is. The leaves on its head reliably grow back if any fall off, and if they are pruned regularly, Petilil can be grown into a fine round shape. Its crescent-shaped white face, seemingly lacking a nose or mouth, has brown eyes shaped like elongated ovals. A green ""bib"" is present on its neck, and its lower body consists of five stubs, two of which act as arms, and two more act as legs. The leaves on Petilil's head are very bitter, which can cause dizziness. However, these leaves possess revitalizing effects such as restoring a person's vigor. This can be achieved by eating the leaves directly, or drying and boiling them into an infusion. This infusion is also sometimes used as a bug repellent. Because of the health effects of its leaves, Petilil is very popular with the elderly. Petilil tends to appear near sources of clean waters. It lives in areas with soil abundant in moisture and nutrients. The homes can be either well-tended fields or flowerbeds. However, they will leave if the environment turns bad. This Pokémon is a female-only species with no male counterpart. In Hisui, the snowy mountainous landscape causes Petilil to gain the Fighting-type when it evolves into Lilligant.

Lilligant is a humanoid Pokémon with plant characteristics. It dons a scarlet flower with white-spotted petals upon its head; said flower has golden filaments with red anther, resembling a crown. It possesses dark green, linear leaves under the flower, and light green, linear leaves underneath the darker leaves. One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden sepal under its neck. It wears a large, light green, tulip shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its ""dress"". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its ""dress"", resembling feet. Though Lilligant is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on Lilligant's head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by Lilligant in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if Lilligant is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by Lilligant's flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy. It is a rare Pokémon that lives in forests. Lilligant is a female-only species with no male counterpart. Lilligant has an ancient regional form: Hisuian Lilligant. In Hisui, Lilligant takes on a drastically different look. Hisuian Lilligant has a thinner build. Its head and body are white, and the latter is covered in light green leaves, with two small slightly darker leaves coming out from either side. On the left side of its head is a six-petaled pink flower with short filaments jutting out from it, and dark green leaves underneath it. The scent released from this flower causes anyone nearby to experience a heartened feeling. Its eyes are light pink and purple. The leaves on its head that resemble hair are much shorter than on Unovan Lilligant. The sepal around its neck is also smaller. Hisuian Lilligant's arms are green, with its forearms being a lighter green. They are much longer and thinner than those of Unovan Lilligant. It also has long, powerful legs, and they are white with a dark pink gradient at the calves. It is suspected that these legs developed as a result of living in the snowy mountains of Hisui; they allow Hisuian Lilligant to jump very high and gracefully. Its feet are golden and cover part of its legs, and they seem to resemble dance shoes or snow boots. A special Hisuian Lilligant is worshiped in Hisui due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from Arceus. In particular, she is one of the Noble Pokémon who resides in Crimson Mirelands. Hisuian Lilligant is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Victory Dance.

It evolves into Krokorok starting at level 29, which evolves into Krookodile starting at level 40. Sandile is a short, quadrupedal Pokémon with a long snout and tail. Its body is mostly light brown with the exception of black stripes crossing over and under its legs and its pink underbelly. It has a black stripe on its snout in front of its eyes, and black covering the tip of its tail. Its eyes resemble shaded binoculars and are shrouded in a black membrane all around their front. This membrane prevents sand from getting in Sandile's eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides. Sandile is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola, where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the anime, in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs. However, Sandile is not very skilled at hunting prey, thus it also mostly eats anything that collapses in the desert; hence it has been known as ""the cleaner of the desert.""

It is classified as a quadruped, though it is more often seen on two legs. It has six thick, black stripes on its body: one at shoulder level, one around its midsection, one around its hips, and three on its tail. Each stripe is topped with a triangular spike on its back. The stripes around its midsection cross two spikes, one on each side of its back. Its arms are short and thin, with a black band around them at the elbow. Each hand contains three short fingers, each with a white claw. Its legs are thick with a band around each ankle, and a stripe above the knee that does not wrap around. Its flat feet each have three white claws. Krokorok's head is ovoid with a long snout, and small eyes surrounded by a thick black membrane. Two of its front and rear teeth are visible overlapping its lower jaw. A black stripe sits on the bridge of the snout just behind its large nostrils. Krokorok prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows Krokorok to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of Krokorok usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female Krokorok while the males gather food. Krokorok dislikes feeling cold, so it burrows into the desert sand at night. It tends to bury its prey in the sand to preserve them in the event of an unsuccessful hunt.

It has five triangular spikes on its back: four around the middle of its back and one large one at the beginning of its tail. All of the smaller spikes on its back are linked to black, triangular spikes that reach around to its front, slightly overlapping its white stomach. The largest spike sits at the beginning of its long thick tail, which has three, thick, black stripes. The last stripe covers the tip of the tail. Its legs are very short and directly attached to its feet. The feet are wrapped in black and have three white claws facing forward. Krookodile's arms are short and thin with a black stripe around the elbow. Its long, thin fingers are each tipped with a white claw. Its head is slightly pointed and contains a distinctive black membrane that surrounds both eyes. The outline of the membrane angles upward sharply, coming to points above the top of Krookodile's head. It uses this distinctive look to harshly intimidate opponents. Its eyes are very powerful, with variable focus, allowing it to see things at a great distance, even in the middle of a desert. Its other notable feature is its long snout, containing a black stripe around the bridge, and large pointed nostrils on the end. Four of its rear and two of its front teeth slightly overlap its lower jaw. Krookodile's jaws are extremely powerful, giving it the ability to crush objects as large and durable as an automobile. The jaws can twist a body before breaking it in half. These features are topped by Krookodile's extremely violent temper. It has been known to clamp down on any moving object and will do everything it can to make sure its prey cannot escape. Krookodile coexists well with Flygon in searching for food, hiding in the sandstorms that Flygon creates as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch. Krookodile has been known as the ""Bully of the Sands"". It uses the sandy terrain as cover to patiently wait for prey to pass by, even throughout the day without rest. Krookodile can swim through the desert sands as if they were water. Not even a thick metal plate is able to withstand a Krookodile's strong jaw bite. Prior to Generation VIII, Power Trip was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.

It has an orange face and curly yellow eyebrows. It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its hands and feet are orange with three digits each. Darumaka has a flame inside its body. While this flame is burning, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep; at rest, its internal temperature is about 1,100 °F . It tucks in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll, which it resembles in this state. Darumaka is well known as a symbol of good luck. It is also known to have very warm droppings, which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm. It prefers to live in a desert environment. Darumaka has a regional form: Galarian Darumaka. Galarian Darumaka's snow-white coat is thicker than that of Unovan Darumaka. It has a pair of turquoise ice crystals in place of its eyebrows. Instead of oval-shaped markings, a pair of diamond-shaped ice crystals adorn its chest like buttons. Its face, hands, and feet are blue rather than orange. Unlike its Unovan counterpart, Galarian Darumaka has a timid frown instead of a mischievous smile. Seismic shift in the Galar region long ago caused the warm climate to cool, and Darumaka in this region have adapted to this cooling. The fire that burned within their bodies went out, leaving an organ that produces cold air instead. The colder Galarian Darumaka gets, the more energetic it becomes. They can focus their internal energy to breathe out cold air in the form of snow, which they use to make snowballs for ammo in playful snowball fights with each other. Galarian Darumaka enjoys eating Berries produced by Snover. This leads it to prey on Snover, often causing it to be driven off by Abomasnow. Darumaka evolves into Darmanitan.

#0555,Darmanitan,Fire,,Sheer,,Zen Mode,Field,,False,"Darmanitan is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V. It evolves from Darumaka starting at level 35. Darmanitan has the ability to change forms during battle, depending on its Ability and current HP. If it has Zen Mode as its Ability, it changes from Standard Mode into Zen Mode when its HP drops to or below half in battle. It will only be in Zen Mode while in battle. When it enters Zen Mode, it is dual-type Fire/Psychic. In Galar, Darmanitan has an Ice-type regional form. It evolves from Galarian Darumaka when exposed to an Ice Stone. When it enters Zen Mode, it is dual-type Ice/Fire. In its normal state, Darmanitan is a mainly red, squat ape-like Pokémon. It has long, bushy flame eyebrows that curl at the base, and round, black-ringed eyes. The upper portion of its tan face is separated from the lower portion by a diagonal red stripe, and its large mouth sports spiked teeth. All these facial features give the impression of a manic or angered expression. Its head has no discernible neck to distinguish it from the rest of the body and its rounded back, which culminates in a stubby tail. It has long arms with spiky hair fringes on the wrists and large tan hands, with a similar arrangement for its hind limbs. Additionally, Darmanitan has three tan ovals on its underside and two wavy lines on its back. In its normal state, it has immense physical strength; a single punch can destroy a dump truck. Its power level scales with the temperature of its internal fire, which can be as hot as 2,500 °F . Darmanitan has a long lifespan as one was recorded living for 2,500 years while sleeping in Zen Mode around Relic Castle. Darmanitan can change from its normal state, called Standard Mode, into Zen Mode. Galarian Darmanitan can change into a different version called Galarian Zen Mode. During Zen Mode, which is accessed by Darmanitan with the hidden Ability Zen Mode, its red fur and tan skin changes blue as it bears the resemblance of a Daruma doll. Its eyes turn blank, and its limbs fuse with its body, rendering them immobile. It also only has three toes, as opposed to normal Darmanitan having five. In this state, it is hard as a rock. As it is rendered immobile, it enters a meditative trance to sharpen its mind, using it as strength emotionally and spiritually to battle and to perform everyday activities such as gather and eat food. Darmanitan has a regional form: Galarian Darmanitan. Galarian Darmanitan has blue skin and a thicker coat than Unovan Darmanitan. Its fur is white, and is adorned with several ice gems; on its face, its fur makes the shape of a beard. Atop its head is a giant snowball that resembles an afro, which is also dotted with several ice crystals. Galarian Darmanitan's biology is the result of it adapting to the cold of the Galar region. It develops an organ that produces cold air, while its flame sac becomes dormant. This also causes its nature to change, from a belligerent personality to a gentle and timid one. It becomes so timid that it will pretend to be a snowman when it senses humans nearby. It uses the snowball on its head to store food and other things it finds, preserving them for later. When in battle, it freezes its giant snowball in order to release powerful headbutts. Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan resembles a snowman. Its false ""head"", located above its actual head, has glowing red-yellow eyes, a warped smile, and a flame sticking out at the center as its ""carrot nose"". Its face sports blank white eyes surrounded by a red mask-like pattern, and an angry grin showing razor-sharp teeth. Its hands become larger and orange, resembling mittens, and it has additional glowing red-yellow spots on its belly. When Galarian Darmanitan enters Zen Mode, its dormant flame sac reignites back to life. This causes Galarian Darmanitan's disposition to change into a maddened rampaging state. It hops around in battle and unleashes fire everywhere without any care for its surroundings, nor if its body starts to melt, making it a threat to others and itself. It will continue rampaging indiscriminately until its rage is completely gone. Darmanitan and its Galarian form are the only known Pokémon that can have Zen Mode as an Ability.

Scraggy is easily engaged in battle, as it will attack anyone that so much as meets its gaze with a headbutt from its thick cranium. The skull is extremely hard. They are known to take pride in their sturdy skulls, causing them to suddenly headbutt everything. However, the weight of its skull makes it hard for Scraggy to balance itself.

It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape.

Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet. Garbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It can also finish off opponents by belting them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps, where it devours garbage in order to grow larger. Consuming garbage also allows Garbodor to create poisons in its body, the type of which depends on the kind of garbage eaten. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Alolan Grimer and Muk, which prey on Garbodor, were introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining Garbodor population stronger than its counterparts from other regions. Garbodor has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Garbodor, its toxic gases become thicker and congeal into the shape of discarded toys, namely: a toy car, blocks, a toy airplane, a toy cruise ship, a substitute doll, a Poké Doll, a Master Ball, a fish skeleton resembling Magikarp, and a toy train.

In Hisui, Zorua has a dual-type Normal/Ghost regional form. It evolves into Hisuian Zoroark starting at level 30. Both it and Zoroark were the first Generation V Pokémon to be revealed to the public on February 10, 2010. Zorua is a slate gray, fox-like Pokémon with red and black accents. Its ears are triangular with dark insides, and it has a large tuft of fur tipped with red on top of its head. It has greenish-blue eyes with red eyelids. There are circular, red markings above the eyes that resemble eyebrows. Its muzzle is short and tapered with two small fangs seen in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Zorua possesses a ruff of black fur around its neck and four short limbs tipped with red. Its tail is short and bushy. Zorua can change its physical appearance, though this transformation is merely an illusion as it keeps its own type and moves. Zorua is said to have a timid nature which led to the development of its illusion abilities. Zorua keeps its true form hidden to ensure its safety and takes on the appearance of other Pokémon to frighten off enemies. Sometimes it will take the form of a silent child in order to search for food. It has been known to occasionally replace normally talkative children. As seen in its movie debut, the tail of an unpracticed Zorua may remain when it takes on a human form, and if the tail is touched, it will revert to its true form. Zorua is mischievous and loves to surprise others. Prior to Generation VII, Zorua and its evolved form, Zoroark, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Night Daze. Additionally, Zorua and Zoroark, as well as their regional forms, are the only known Pokémon that can have Illusion as an Ability. Zorua has an ancient regional form: Hisuian Zorua. Exiled from other lands by humans because of their illusions, and unable to survive in the Hisui region due to the harsh environment and conflicts with other Pokémon, the souls of deceased Zorua linger on in a new form, reborn by their malice towards humans and Pokémon alike. Hisuian Zorua's fur is mainly light gray with red and white accents. Its ears are primarily gray with split cuts and a slight red tint at the tips. Its eyes have golden yellow irises and pink eyelids, and its limbs are tipped in black. The tuft of fur on its head, the ruff around its neck, and its tail are all white at their bases, with long wisps of fur that fade to red at the tips, and they are all smoother in appearance. Unlike Unovan Zorua, it has a melancholy expression rather than a mischievous one. Hisuian Zorua retains its ability to cast illusions but accomplishes this by constantly unleashing its spiteful power of malice through its ghostly fur, specifically atop its head. It can attack its target with a spine-chilling resentment. This power comes from Hisuian Zorua's own resentment of everything. If it encounters a lone human or Pokémon, Zorua may appear to them masked in a horrifying illusion of their own likeness. It seems to draw strength from the terror it inflicts on its victims. Hisuian Zorua tends to reside in the cold areas where it lingers onto. Like its Unova counterpart, Hisuian Zorua can make its illusion of other Pokémon, to the point of easily fooling anyone in order to get food.

Zoroark initially debuted as a silhouette before being revealed in full.The Hisuian forms of it and Zorua were revealed in a teaser video on October 21, 2021. Zoroark is a bipedal, slate gray, fox-like Pokémon with crimson and black accents. It has a pointed snout and ears with red insides. It also has some red that rims its eyes and mouth. Zoroark has a large, red, voluminous mane with black tips, tied into a ponytail, as a teal bangle down its length separates a mass of the mane from the lower portion. It has a black ruff on its upper body, pointed at the shoulders from which its arms extend. Its upper arms are thin, whereas its lower arms, while still slim, are bulkier. The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises. Zoroark can create illusions that are indistinguishable from reality, deluding many people simultaneously. It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect. Lonely Trainers tend to use Zoroark to create illusions in order to ease their own burden of solitude. There are stories of Zoroark punishing people who tried to capture it with illusions. Zoroark lives in groups, where unity is strong. It is extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking its own life, and it can hold grudges against those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide its Zorua young in its mane to protect them and carry them around. There are stories that say Zoroark punishes those who attempt to catch it by trapping them in an illusion.

Additionally, Zoroark, its pre-evolved form, Zorua, and their regional forms, are the only known Pokémon that can have Illusion as an Ability. Zoroark has a Hisuian regional form: Hisuian Zoroark. In the Hisui region, Zoroark takes on a drastic ghostly appearance due to dying from the harsh conditions and being reborn through spite. Its main body color is now disheveled with light gray with red and white accents. Hisuian Zoroark's head and face are similar to its Unova counterpart but colored gray. It has gray ears with black insides and two white markings on both sides of the face. The ears also have light red split parts. The long mane has changed into a longer mane that is colored white with the ends of each tips being colored light and dark red, while covering the right side of Zoroark's face. The arms and legs have several red spots and light red fur that dangles around. The claws and toes of Zoroark are colored black. The eyes are now red with yellow sclera. As a result of its appearance, Hisuian Zoroark was said to resemble an embodiment of death. The illusions channeled through Hisuian Zoroark's long withering fur are full of spite. Uniquely, this spiteful illusion can cause physical harm to its opponent on both the inside and outside. This power comes from the hatred it has for every living thing in the world. Hisuian Zoroark's illusion malice is powerful enough to drive anyone who sees it to insanity due to their terror. Hisuian Zoroark recklessly attacks its foes or nemeses, to the point its own bitter energy can cause physical harm onto itself. Despite its extremely hostile and aggressive nature to everything, Hisuian Zoroark can be compassionate to those it cares about, such as Hisuian Zorua, and it will become an invaluable ally once someone earns its trust. Hisuian Zoroark prefers to reside in the cold areas where it lingers onto. Like its Unova counterpart, Hisuian Zoroark can make its illusion of humans talking, to the point of easily fooling anyone in order to get food.

Lampent can sense when someone is about to die, whom it visits and steals the spirit from the person's body. Though most often found in deep forests, it quietly wanders through cities and hangs around near hospitals to absorb the spirits of the fallen. It also pretends to be a lamp while in cities. Because of this, Lampent is feared as the emissary of death. It uses the spirits it has absorbed to fuel its fire.

These markings can generate electricity. It has small, horizontal, oval-shaped eyes, white with a tiny black pupil and no irises. Almost exactly between these two eyes lies the two thick gray lips that form its mouth. It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they're wings to remain airborne. Stunfisk lives in mudflats and coastal areas, and thanks to the bacteria which lived alongside it, it developed the organs which it uses to generate electricity. Stunfisk's very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in the mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touches a Stunfisk's body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes for a reason that is still not yet known. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away. Stunfisk smiling Stunfisk flying Stunfisk has a regional form: Galarian Stunfisk. Galarian Stunfisk is grayish-brown, with three green markings similar to footprints or leaves on its body. It cannot generate electricity, but the high iron content of the mud it lives in has strengthened its fins, which have been adapted into an apparatus akin to a bear trap. It leaves its red and white mouth, which looks similar to a Poké Ball, visible to lure in prey and then slams its fins shut on them so they cannot escape.

It has a long, skinny tail that, like its paw fur, is tipped purple and split at its end. Mienshao is respectful and is usually seen training with its Trainer. When facing a truly challenging opponent, Mienshao will bite off the fur from its arms to make itself lighter. Its arm fur is used as a weapon in battle and acts like a battle whip. Before it attacks, it lets out a bizarre wail. It then creates combination attacks that are difficult to see and overwhelmingly unstoppable, and slowly stores up power for a finishing blow. When using its blinding speed, Mienshao can crush massive boulders into tiny pieces.

There is a crack across the chest of the armor, which is patched diagonally with a brown seal resembling a belt. It has a crystal-like formation on each shoulder, and there are large bangles on its wrists and ankles. It has a Roman armor-like ""skirt"" and flat feet beneath. There is an unproven theory that Golurk contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy. Despite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond, the anime, and Pokémon Adventures. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes Golurk to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging Golurk can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble.

It then clangs its arm blades together afterwards. Any chips in Pawniard's blades would prove fatal for it; thus, Pawniard regularly sharpens its blades with its favorite sharpening stones found by rivers. Pawniard is noted to be an especially courageous fighter. In the wild, Pawniard lives in packs governed by Bisharp.

It has a round, red and black head, similar to a war helmet, topped with a golden, double-headed axe blade with white edges. The helmet shrouds most of its yellow-and-black face, although its triangular eyes are visible. Resembling shoulder pads, Bisharp's red shoulders project slightly over its arms and have a thin yellow line where they meet its black torso. It has white, metallic hands that resemble gloves, with retractable, sharp blades attached. Encircling its torso are two blades, which create the impression of a ribcage. Its thighs are red and become progressively thinner as they connect to the knee. Both of its feet are metallic and split down the middle, resembling cloven hooves. These hooves are also similar to steel war boots or possibly leggings. In the wild, Bisharp rules over a pack of Pawniard, and fights other Bisharp to become the alpha of the pack. The loser of these fights is cast out. It is notably pitiless, having no expression when finishing off prey, and is also said to use underhanded tactics during battles. When hunting, the Pawniard allow the leader Bisharp to perform the finishing blow. Once a Bisharp's head blade is chipped or damaged, it retires from its position as boss. Bisharp keeps a close eye on members of its pack to ensure none of the Pawniard think about betraying it, and absorbs defeated packs into its own tribe during territorial disputes. The Bisharp tribes are in turn spearheaded by Kingambit, which has been known to lead gangs of Bisharp into battle. It is said that only the most outstanding members of the Bisharp tribes can evolve into Kingambit. Bisharp typically lives near forested areas.

There are black tear markings directly below its eyes. Each of its beige legs has a single, gray hoof and its tail ends in a stubby tuft of fur. A territorial Pokémon, it will headbutt anyone that attempts to invade its territory. However, in the anime, it has been known not to attack those with an afro hairstyle. Protected by its afro, which absorbs damage, its headbutts are strong enough to derail a train and send it flying. It can also destroy a car with just a Headbutt. The more hair a Bouffalant has on its head, the higher positions it has in the herd. A herd of Bouffalant consists of 20 individuals. For unclear reasons, a Bouffalant loses its hair from its head should it ever betray its herd. Bouffalant is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Head Charge.",95,110,95,40,95,55

Rufflet also preys on Spewpa. Rufflet is extremely aggressive from birth and knowingly provokes opponents larger and more powerful than itself, including its own parent to gain acceptance. It sees this as a means of quickly getting stronger. The more times Rufflet faints or gets injured, the stronger it becomes. Rufflet will start crying whenever it loses a battle.

However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that Genesect can be found in Glittering Cave. By folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect can assume a flying saucer-like configuration, allowing it to fly. This configuration is known in Japanese as the 高速飛行形態 high-speed flight configuration. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Genesect can breathe in outer space. Genesect has four alternate forms determined by the Drive it holds: Shock Drive, Burn Drive, Chill Drive, and Douse Drive.

When its mouth is open, two upper fangs can be seen. On top of its head is a mass of fluffy pink fur with a red cherry-like sphere on top. On either side of its head, its pink fur forms a spherical shape similar to ears. Around its neck is a wavy, red collar and there is a red spot on the left side of its chest. It has small, pink feet with three toes and stubby arms. Slurpuff has an exceptionally keen sense of smell that is 100 million times stronger than that of a human. This allows it to distinguish even the faintest of smells and assist pastry chefs in the cooking. Slurpuff can tell a person's mental and physical condition by taking in their scent. Its fur contains a lot of air, making it light and soft to the touch. Prior to Generation VII, Slurpuff and its pre-evolved form, Swirlix, were the only known Pokémon that could have Sweet Veil as an Ability. Slurpuff evolves from Swirlix.",82,80,86,85,75,72

It has a transparent mantle with a rounded, pink body inside that has several yellow, circular spots that can glow brightly. There are four of these luminescent spots on the front and two on the back. Attached to its mantle are two transparent tentacles; its remaining tentacles are part of its main body, eight in total. It has round black eyes and a pink beak-like mouth. Inkay can cause its luminescent spots to blink and flash; this behavior serves a variety of uses. If Inkay is threatened, the blinking lights will cause its opponents to become dazed and lose their will to battle, allowing it to escape. The blinking also serves to attract Inkay's prey, which is then ensnared and held in place by its tentacles. Inkay also uses various complex rhythms and patterns of lights to communicate to others of its kind. Because of this, Inkay instinctively reacts to anything in its habitat that emits light or echoing sounds. By floating upside-down, Inkay improves its blood flow along with clearing its head. This also drastically boosts the power of Inkay's Psychic moves and is what triggers its evolution into Malamar. Prior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX, Inkay and its evolved form, Malamar, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy. Inkay evolves into Malamar.",53,54,53,37,46,45

On each side of the mantle is a long tentacle with dark pink at the top and white, scythe-like fins at the ends. The edge of Malamar's fins are said to be supremely sharp. Malamar possesses strong hypnotic powers, which are said to be the most powerful of any Pokémon. Malamar uses its hypnotic power to force others to do its bidding. Those under Malamar's control will lose their memories surrounding the event. People often utilize this ability for nefarious deeds. Malamar's hypnotic powers are said to have played a role in several history-changing events. It lures prey with the flashing pattern on its luminescent body and hypnotic motions, then ensnares them in its tentacles. The prey is then finished off with digestive fluids. Both the anime and the TCG show Malamar living near water or even under water. As shown in Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!, it uses its tentacles to propel itself, swimming leg-first.

On either side of its body is a rounded, light blue fin and it has a striated, purple belly. Its tail is composed of three leaf-like fins. Skrelp is a poor swimmer, and gets easily washed away by storms. Skrelp rides seaweed as a form of traveling the ocean. It camouflages itself as the seaweed to hide from enemies while storing power for evolution. It also uses this technique to hide from prey, which it sprays with liquid poison when approached. However, its main source of food is rotten seaweed, which it uses to create its poison. Skrelp is known to coexist well with Dhelmise. Skrelp evolves into Dragalge.",50,60,60,60,60,30

Clauncher is a crustacean Pokémon that resembles a bright blue shrimp. It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. One claw forms a single, sharp point; and the other is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail. Clauncher's large claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. Occasionally, its claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea. Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when it was alive.

The pincer is dark blue with a pair of thin, yellow antennae on top, three overlapping segments with a black stripe along the back edge, and four black spikes attached to the back of the last segment. The movable lower portion of the pincer is yellow, as is the inner portion of the pincer's last segment, which has three stripes patterning it. Clawitzer are a territorial species, known to fiercely battle against each other. Clawitzer's massive claw can suck up water and launch it as compressed cannonballs capable of piercing tanker hulls. By using the gases inside its body, water can also be expelled from the nozzle on the back, which allows it to travel at speeds of up to 60 knots. The feelers on Clawitzer's claws can detect the location of its prey. The claw itself is packed with meat, which can be used as a cooking ingredient.

On either side of its head hangs a pointed, extension with a yellow tip. These can stiffen and expand into a frill. These frills have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. This allows it to create its own energy and thrive without food in its desert home. The frills act similar to solar panels and are the source of Helioptile's electric moves. However should this process get interrupted, Helioptile will be stressed to the point of weakness. As seen in one of its attack animations in the games, its head and frills glow with a pale yellow light when it uses certain moves.

It leaps around to stay in its opponent's blind spots and controls its position in the air by using its wings. A favored tactic is to strike from above because it is a difficult maneuver to defend against. However, Hawlucha has a tendency to show off in the heat of battle; opponents can exploit its vanity to gain the upper hand. In Paldea, Primeape is Hawlucha's natural enemy.

The simple, lower whiskers are organs that can fire electricity. However, Dedenne is small and its electricity-generating organ is under-developed, making it unable to generate a lot of electricity on its own. It absorbs electricity from other electric Pokémon, or from homes and buildings by plugging its tail into outlets; Dedenne are known to live near humans due to this behavior.

Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type. Klefki are known to be very even-tempered. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines. When the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved on to human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.

#0718,Zygarde,Dragon, Ground,Aura,,,,,True,"Zygarde is a dual-type Dragon/Ground Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VI. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Zygarde has three forms: 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and Complete Forme. Additionally, there are two basic components of Zygarde: Zygarde Cores, which act as the brains of Zygarde, and Zygarde Cells, which compose Zygarde's forms and are non-sentient. Neither Zygarde Cores nor Zygarde Cells can use moves or are useful in battles by themselves. They are stored inside a Zygarde Cube. Zygarde 50% Forme was introduced in Pokémon X and Y. The Zygarde Cells, Zygarde Cores, Zygarde 10% Forme, and Zygarde Complete Forme were revealed in the October 2015 issue of CoroCoro magazine and later introduced in Pokémon Sun and Moon. A Zygarde Core played an important role in the anime's XY&Z arc. Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal are often collectively referred to as the Aura trio by fans. Zygarde is a green and black Pokémon whose form depends on the percentage of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells it has gathered together. Zygarde's Cores and Cells do not have the power to battle alone and can only fight when combined to form Zygarde. Zygarde serves as the protector of the planet's ecosystem. Zygarde is shown to be capable of gathering the energy of the land and focus it on its foes, damaging them. It has the ability to divide its cells from its body temporarily, using them as weapons, either as arrows or waves. Zygarde usually stays out of the sight of others. It has been referred to as a ""guardian of the ecosystem"" due to its role to defend the world's order and the ""Z"" due to its name. Zygarde keeps a close watch on the planet and on its two counterparts Xerneas and Yveltal, ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. Normally, Zygarde avoids getting involved in conflicts unless the ecosystem is in grave danger. As seen in Pokémon the Series, should Zygarde be affected by outside influence, its color changes from green to red. Zygarde is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Land's Wrath, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Waves, and Core Enforcer. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Aura Break and Power Construct as its Abilities. Zygarde has three forms: 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and Complete Forme, which are composed of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells. Zygarde Cores are the brains of the Zygarde, and a Zygarde may contain up to five Cores. A Zygarde Core is a small, green Pokémon with a gelatinous body. It has a large, round head with a beak-shaped protrusion on the front, a thin, hook-shaped tail, and a red hexagon suspended in its body. Within its head is a single eye with a black pupil; beside this eye is another white oval that may be a second eye. The Zygarde Core remains in watch of the region, usually living in caves. The Cores have their own will and are sometimes able to act on their own. The Zygarde Core can order Zygarde Cells, commanding them to fly towards it to form Zygarde's body in order to protect the ecosystem. Zygarde Cores are capable of absorbing sunlight to regain their strength, can speak telepathically, communicate with other Cores, and use the Cells to observe the ecosystem, as depicted in the Pokémon the Series episode Love Strikes! Eevee, Yikes!. Zygarde Cells make up every other part of Zygarde and appear nearly identical to the Zygarde Core. Unlike the Core, it has a flat body and head. It has a green pupil, a simpler, unhooked tail, and a darker green, more elongated hexagon within its midsection. Zygarde Cells tend to be scattered around the Pokémon world. The Zygarde Cells form the rest of Zygarde's body and are only able to act on the Core's orders. The Zygarde Cells allows the Zygarde Core to observe the ecosystem, allowing them to see through their eyes, as depicted in Love Strikes! Eevee, Yikes!. The Cells also have the ability to fly in amazing speed, allowing them to reach a Zygarde Core from far away. The 10% Forme has a relatively small canine body. It is primarily black with a green collar and a leash-like extension on its neck. Additional green markings include two hexagon markings on its chest, a small hexagon over each eye, the area around its mouth, and its front left paw. There is an elongated, red hexagon marking attached to the collar marking. Its eyes are white hexagons with no discernible pupils and there is a thin, white line on its forehead. On each of its legs are hexagonal extensions: two on the back of each elbow, one behind each knee, and two on each hip. One of the hip extensions is longer than the other on each hip. Zygarde 10% Forme also has razor-sharp teeth. 10% Zygarde is created when a Zygarde Core combines with only a tenth of the total Zygarde Cells. The 10% Forme is skilled at close range combat. It is also capable of running at speeds greater than 60 miles per hour . A single Core acts as the brain for the 10% form. This allows it to take action separately from Zygarde's 50% Forme, which comprises its main body, for a short time before separating.",108,100,121,81,95,95

There are four spike-like crystals along the top, a long crystal on either side hanging downward, and a large circular centerpiece on its forehead. There is a small, golden piece hanging off the center crystal and a small pink diamond embedded in the back of its head. Diancie is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mysterious mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air. Diancie uses these diamonds to both attack and defend itself. Diancie's pink, glimmering body is said to be one of the most loveliest sights to experience in the world. Diancie is also said to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon seen in the world. Diancie is found living in underground caves filled with diamonds such as the Diamond Domain, a crystal kingdom where it reigns as queen over many Carbink, as it has occasionally been seen traveling or living with others. Diancie can speak through telepathy, as depicted in the movie Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction. Diancie can Mega Evolve into Mega Diancie. As Mega Diancie, its white dress becomes longer and loses its sleeves. Its lower body turns into a pink crystal and is surrounded by a series of long crystals similar to those on its headdress. On the back, both the dress and the crystals are longer, and additional, smaller crystals are suspended from the tips of the larger ones. The tips of the circlet around its neck curve outward and there is an additional half-circlet around its waist. The centerpiece of its headdress is now heart-shaped, and the remaining crystals are slightly smaller. The crystals hanging from the sides of its head have additional crystals suspended from the tips, and there is an additional hanging crystal on the back of its head. The diamond on the back of its head becomes rounded and two smaller gems form at the lower corners. Two ribbon-like structures grow from these additional gems; each ribbon has two small crystals suspended from the tips. The head diamond measures over 2,000 carats. Thanks to the Mega Evolution energy, Diancie's manipulation over diamonds has grown so much, that Mega Diancie can now create a sword out of them during battle. Due to the impurities on the surface of body having fallen away, Mega Diancie can now shine so brilliantly that when reflecting light, one cannot look directly at it. In this form, it was known as the ""Royal Pink Princess"" due to its colors and appearance.

Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward. This alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom. In Hisui, Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type. Dartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have the Ability Long Reach. Dartrix evolves from Rowlet and evolves into Decidueye In Hisui, it evolves from Rowlet and evolves into Hisuian Decidueye.",78,75,75,70,70,52

It has a nomadic lifestyle, wandering the Hisui region in search of food. Unlike its Alolan counterpart, it prefers to fight at close range in order to overwhelm enemies.

When it arches its back, three-pointed tufts of fur with red tips appear along its spine. Litten is a solitary Pokémon that does not typically display its emotions, and it is usually advised that it not be given too much affection. It will scratch those who try to pet it without earning its trust, which takes some time to develop. While grooming, Litten collects fur inside its stomach. By setting the stored fur alight, it can spit fireballs that change based on how it coughs. Litten's fur produces flammable oils, and when it begins shedding, it burns all its fur in a blaze. Its fur coat regrows twice a year. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.",45,65,40,60,40,70

Each paw has three toes, but the front ones are larger with short, black claws. Its tail has several tufts of fur on the tip. Torracat has large eyes with black outlines, yellow sclerae, and black pupils that have a red tint along the bottom. Torracat's mane consists of two long tufts of fur on each of its cheeks, with a shorter tuft just underneath on either side of its chin. This mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing Torracat to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. Torracat's mane is also an indicator of its health; its mane stands on end when it is in a good mood and lies flat when it is not feeling well. It has a tiny, triangular gray nose and long, pointed ears with gray insides. Hanging from Torracat's neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange center. This organ is actually Torracat's flame sac, which produces flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The temperature of Torracat's bell-like organ will rise based on its emotions, or when facing a powerful opponent. The release of fire from Torracat's flame sac creates the sound of a bell. Despite sometimes acting spoiled with those it trusts, Torracat has a fierce battle spirit. Torracat will let a trainer it trusts cuddle with it. The trainer Torracat bonds with will occasionally get covered in scratches by it. The scratches from Torracat's strong claws are powerful.

The flames from its navel can reach a temperature of up to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. This Pokémon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. Incineroar usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pokémon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage. It also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When Incineroar's fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel, Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pokémon. It is also willing to help out children and small Pokémon, further showing its hidden soft side. In Generation VII, Darkest Lariat was its signature move.

Large groups of Brionne can be seen dancing together on moonlit nights when the sea is calm, sometimes being led by the singing of a Primarina. Brionne has a caring nature; if its Trainer is feeling down, it will perform a dance to cheer them up. As Brionne dances, it creates water balloons in a variety of colors. Its battle strategy consists of dancing while creating water balloons. The dance confuses the opponent, and during this weakness, Brionne slaps the balloons toward the target where they explode.

On its body are three fins similar to the one on its crown: one that drapes around its shoulders and chest, one around its waist where the fishtail begins, and one near the tip of its tail. It has long front fins with three digits. Primarina's long fishlike tail is bright blue with small pointed, pink fins around its hips. Its tail fins are white, and it is capable of using them as feet to stand up. Primarina uses water balloons and its voice as its main weapons. Because its voice is instrumental in its battle strategy, its care should be a priority for Trainers. The melody it uses has been passed down for generations. Water balloons are released as it dances, and are controlled by its voice. In the moonlight, the balloons glitter and create a beautiful scene. However, some of the balloons are explosive and triggered by touch. This theatrical Pokémon considers every battle a stage and uses the non-explosive balloons as platforms to tease opponents.

While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Oricorio can change forms by sipping the Nectar of certain flowers. Oricorio is an avian Pokémon that can change between four markedly different forms. The form it takes depends on the kind of nectar it consumes. All forms have a light pink beak, thin legs, and dark eyes with white pupils. The feet have three toes in front and one in back, and the beak curves downward. Oricorio is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Revelation Dance, which changes its type according to Oricorio's style. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Dancer as an Ability. In its Baile Style, which resides on Ula'ula Island in Alola and in eastern Paldea, Oricorio is covered in red feathers with two lines of black feathers across each of its wings and tail. Its plumage resembles a frilly flamenco dress. On the back of its head is a white ball with thin, spiraled extensions on either side that resemble earrings. Its eyelids are purple, and it has a long tail. Baile Style Oricorio is very passionate and exudes power when it dances and can get fiercely angry if it is given the wrong orders. It throws off downy fluff when it dances that it can ignite to perform a fiery dance attack. Baile Style Oricorio is popular with the people of Paldea due to its dancing style matching their temperament nature. In its Pom-Pom Style, residing on Melemele Island in Alola and in southern Paldea, Oricorio is primarily yellow. Most of its body is pale yellow with a line of longer feathers around its waist like a skirt. Its lower body and short stubby tail are covered with short, white feathers. Fluffy balls of darker yellow feathers cover the end of its wings like pom-poms, and similar, smaller puffs cover its ankles.

The markings around its eyes are echoed by three large, pale yellow feathers on each side of its head, which are tipped with bright yellow. Pom-Pom Style Oricorio's dancing charges its feathers with static electricity. While charged, its feathers can be used to attack and unleash electric shocks. It will also use its dancing to cheer up people who are feeling glum, but will also use this as an opening to shock unsuspecting foes. In Paldea, Pom-Pom Style is popular with children due to its energetic, cheerful dance. However, it is hard to find in said region. In its Pa'u Style, residing on Akala Island in Alola and in the Terarium's Coastal Biome in Unova, Oricorio has pink feathers.

There is a larger, similar group of feathers around its waist like a skirt. Pa'u Style Oricorio can be difficult to deal with due to its laid-back nature. It uses its dance to focus its mind and increase its psychic power. The dance is also said to be an offering of thanks to its guardian deity. It gets caught up in dancing that it sometimes ignores its Trainer's orders. In Paldea, Pau'u Style Oricorio is popular due to being used to maintain health. However, it is hard to find in said region. It is more commonly seen in the Terarium. In its Sensu Style, residing on Poni Island in Alola and in southwest Kitakami, Oricorio's feathers are mainly purple. The tips of its wings broaden into a fan shape, and it has a fan-shaped crest on top of its head. At the base of its crest are four feathers with light blue tips. There are two of these feathers on each side, resembling ornamental hairsticks. On the side of each eye are small, light blue markings that resemble eyelashes. The edges of its wings, fans, head crest, and long tail all have a double border of pale purple with a light blue on the outer edge. Sensu Style Oricorio is a calm and collected Pokémon. Through its dance, it draws in nearby spirits and borrows their power to fight. Its dance reminds people who migrated from Kanto of their homeland. In Paldea, Sensu Style Oricorio is popular with adults due to its elegant, attractive dance. However, it is hard to find in said region. It is more commonly seen in Kitakami.",75,70,70,98,70,93

Cutiefly is a tiny Pokémon with a pair of comparatively large wings. It has a pale yellow body with a white face and tail. It has large eyes with spots resembling pixels in them, a long brown proboscis, and two tiny transparent tufts on its head resembling antennae. It has wide, flat white wings with a brown loop marking toward the bottom. In between its wings is a white tuft of fuzz. It has four spindly legs with round feet. Cutiefly is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pokémon. It uses this ability to predict the movements of its opponents. Cutiefly's diet consists of pollen and nectar, drinking it through its long proboscis. Any pollen it does not finish is stored in its fur. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles a flower in full bloom. As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. When Cutiefly draws close, it will painfully poke them with its long proboscis. This Pokémon can be found in fields and meadows but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings. Loving nectar and pollen, it often gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. It is known to be drawn in by Fomantis's sweet scent and Gossifleur's pollen. Spinarak and Pineco are natural predators of Cutiefly. Cutiefly is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. Additionally, it is the lightest Bug-type Pokémon in existence.

#0743,Ribombee,Bug, Fairy,Honey, Shield,Sweet Veil,Bug, Fairy,False,"Ribombee is a dual-type Bug/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Cutiefly starting at level 25. Ribombee is a tiny, insectoid Pokémon with a large head, slightly smaller body, and thin arms and legs. It is covered in fluffy, yellow hair and has a white face and lower body, and a tuft of hair on its back. It has big eyes with one white and one brown square speck in the center. Over its eyes are white hairs similar to eyelashes, and it has two black antennae. Around its neck is a brown scarf with a needle-like projection on the front. Two wings nearly as large as its body sprout from its back. The wings are white with three brown loop designs near the base. Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet. It is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. Ribombee uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain turns its hair dirty and its pollen damp, so it only visits fields if the weather remains clear. When storms are on the horizon, Ribombee hide in tree hollows and wait stock-still. The pollen and nectar it collects are used to form balls called ""Pollen Puffs"". These balls can be used as food or relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable nutritious supplements. When Rimbombee senses a human or Pokémon feeling sad, it will cheer them up using handmade pollen puffs. In Generation VII, Pollen Puff was its signature move. A special Ribombee in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Seafolk Village's Island trial. Ribombee evolves from Cutiefly.",60,55,60,95,70,124

#0746,Wishiwashi,Water,,Schooling,,,Water 2,,False,"Wishiwashi is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Wishiwashi can change forms with its Schooling Ability if it has reached level 20. When Wishiwashi enters a battle or ends a turn with its HP above 25%, it changes from Solo Form to School Form. School Form Wishiwashi will revert to Solo Form Wishiwashi if its HP is below 25%. Wishiwashi is a fishlike Pokémon. It has two different forms depending on the situation. In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type. An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans, Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles away. Wishiwashi is the only known Pokémon that can have Schooling as an Ability. Wishiwashi has two interchangeable forms: Solo Form and School Form. In its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each become a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its ""eyes"" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the ""eye"" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi's mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth. On each side of the School Form's body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi can fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each ""finger"" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it. Three spikes encircle the tip of its tail, each with two glowing dots at the base. Dark fish shapes float freely a short distance from the end of each spike, all with two more dots on them. Finally, the tip of its tail is a rounded teardrop shape with a single dot on each side. The people of Alola and Galar also fear Wishiwashi and call it the ""demon of the sea"" due to its School Form. Even the fearsome Gyarados and Wailord are known to flee from it when it enters School Form. Wishiwashi assumes this form whenever a Wishiwashi is in danger or is bullied. Wishiwashi can concentrate their powers when assembled. The School Form's Water Gun is said to be more powerful than a Hydro Pump move. Should it get wounded in School Form, Wishiwashi will split into a regular school before fleeing. A special School From Wishiwashi in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Brooklet Hill's trial. Another special School Form Wishiwashi is worshiped in Lental for being one of the seven guardians Illumina Pokémon. It resides in the Maricopia Islands Illumina Spot.",45,20,20,25,25,40
#0747,Mareanie,Poison, Water,Merciless, Limber,Regenerator,Water 1,,False,"Mareanie is a dual-type Poison/Water Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Toxapex starting at level 38. Mareanie is a Pokémon with a purple, stalk-like body and head. It has blue eyes with yellow pupils and sclerae, and three pointed teeth. The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center. Mareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola — except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode, The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!, it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. Mareanie live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans. Mareanie and its evolution, Toxapex, are the only known Pokémon that can have Merciless as an Ability. Mareanie evolves into Toxapex.",50,53,62,43,52,45
#0748,Toxapex,Poison, Water,Merciless, Limber,Regenerator,Water 1,,False,"Toxapex is a dual-type Poison/Water Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Mareanie starting at level 38. Toxapex is a small Pokémon with twelve large, starfish-like legs sprouting from the top of its head. It has bright blue eyes with yellow sclerae and pupils. The main part of its body, consisting of a small head with protrusions similar to starfish arms below it, is a purplish pink. Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs. The legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top. Toxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours , even to Pokémon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy. Toxapex competes against it in warm ocean currents, despite the odds being against it. Toxapex is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker. It and its pre-evolution, Mareanie, are also the only known Pokémon that can have Merciless as an Ability. Toxapex evolves from Mareanie.",50,63,152,53,142,35

Mudbray is a quadrupedal, equine Pokémon resembling a small donkey. It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof. Mudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Mudbray's diet consists of eating dirt in order to create mud. It then regurgitated the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to the sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola. Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea, suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction. Prior to Generation IX, Mudbray and its evolved form, Mudsdale, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stamina as an Ability. Mudbray evolves into Mudsdale.",70,100,70,45,55,45
#0750,Mudsdale,Ground,,Own, Stamina,Inner Focus,Field,,False,"Mudsdale is a Ground-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Mudbray starting at level 30. Mudsdale is a large, equine Pokémon with short, brown fur and a black-and-red mane and tail. It has heavy-lidded, black eyes with a red rim along the bottom, a red blaze on its muzzle, and long, pointed black ears with brown insides. This Pokémon's mane extends down around its eyes. Along the top of its neck, its mane is black with red at the tip, and stands up straight. On either side of its neck, the mane forms three thick structures similar to dreadlocks with red mud around the tips. The mane extends all the way down Mudsdale's back in a thin line before becoming its tail. The tail appears similar to its dreadlocks but is much larger and has several black notches missing from the mud around the tip. Around its hooves is a protective coating of red mud, which has three notches around the bottom. Mudsdale is known for both its powerful body and emotional fortitude, which prevents it from becoming agitated. Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and will defeat opponents with a single blow. The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car or large truck into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone. Because of its unique qualities, the walls of some old houses were coated with Mudsdale's mud. Mudsdale is highly treasured for both physical labor and pottery made from its high-quality mud. In Alola, Mudsdale is used as a Ride Pokémon called Mudsdale Gallop, to allow natives to travel across rocky terrains. Prior to Generation IX, Mudsdale and its pre-evolved form, Mudbray, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stamina as an Ability. Mudsdale evolves from Mudbray.",100,125,100,55,85,35
#0751,Dewpider,Water, Bug,Water,,Water Absorb,Water 1, Bug,False,"Dewpider is a dual-type Water/Bug Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Araquanid starting at level 22. Dewpider is a Pokémon resembling a spider with a water bubble over its head. Its head and most of its abdomen are dark gray, while its thorax and six legs are light green. All of its legs are thin with a knobby joint in the middle, and three of its legs are typically used to anchor the bubble on its head. Sometimes Dewpider will secretly swap which legs will hold up the bubble. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings. Several triangular flaps extend upward and attach to the bubble over its head. The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and a light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which the anime has shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles. Dewpider can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over their head allows them to breathe on land. Dewpider uses the sticky silk it creates to form a sturdy water bubble that will rarely burst. Additionally, the bubble protects its soft head and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two Dewpider meet, they compare bubbles and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way. It supports the water bubble that envelops its head with three of its legs. Dewpider and its evolved form, Araquanid, are the only known Pokémon that can have Water Bubble as an Ability.",38,40,52,40,72,27

Araquanid is an arachnoid Pokémon with a water bubble around its head. The majority of its body is dark gray with accents of yellow-green and light brown. It has large, blue eyes with a paler wavy line through the centers. Above its eyes are light brown markings similar to eyebrows. It has three pointed, blue bumps on top of its head and four fang-like projections underneath. Both the bumps and its eyes are capable of glowing. Its abdomen was a light brown stripe down the center of its back with two horizontal lines crossing it. Several light brown extensions at its neck flare out and connect to the bubble around its head. At the end of its abdomen is a light green spinneret. It has six light green legs with opaque bubbles around the joints. The tips of its legs are dark gray. Araquanid uses the bubble around its head as both a weapon and a protective shield. The bubbles it launches will have a sticky effect. It will headbutt enemies with it, and small Pokémon can be sucked in and drowned. Foes it traps inside these bubbles will lose consciousness before getting torn apart by Araquanid’s gnashing jaws. Subdued prey can also be stored inside when the Araquanid is not hungry. However, it will also bring weaker Pokémon and valuable items into the bubble for protection. Notably, it carries around its Dewpider children while feeding them with food within the head bubble. Araquanid and its pre-evolved form, Dewpider, are the only known Pokémon that can have Water Bubble as an Ability. A special Aranquaid in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Brooklet Hill's Island trial. Araquanid evolves from Dewpider.",68,70,92,50,132,42
#0753,Fomantis,Grass,,Leaf,,Contrary,Grass,,False,"Fomantis is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Lurantis when leveled up in the day starting at level 34. Fomantis is a small, plantlike Pokémon. It has large, dark pink eyes with slightly darker pupils. Bunches of light green leaves surround its head, and a particularly large tuft in front slightly overhangs its face. A small, dark green bulb sprouts from the center of its head, which emits a pleasant aroma. Around its neck is a collar of short, dark green leaves. Extending from its collar are four lighter green leaves with white tips: two in the front and two in the back. In the front, these leaves act as scythe-like arms. Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs. In order to achieve evolution, Fomantis stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day, it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy. Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Bug Pokémon like Cutiefly are known to gather near it due to its scent. Trainers who own Fomantis tend to give it a flowerpot, allowing it to sunbathe in peace. Fomantis evolves into Lurantis.",40,55,35,50,35,35

It has a light pink body with wavy, skirt-like extensions around the waist and a green abdomen and neck. Its thin, white arms end in large, red scythes with white along the bottom rim and a single green claw on the tip. There are vertical, pink-and-red stripes down its legs, which have small, pointed green feet. The coloring and shape of Lurantis's body and arms give it the appearance of wearing a long-sleeved dress, while its legs are similar to pants. Four red, wing-like appendages sprout from its back, each tipped with white. Lurantis both looks and smells like a flower, a trait that it exploits to lure foes in for a surprise attack. Its brilliant coloration and elegant moves have earned it acclaim as the most glamorous Grass-type Pokémon. However, it does disguise itself as a Bug Pokémon for protection. Maintaining its appearance requires detailed grooming. If a Trainer does a good job caring for it, Lurantis will have an easier time trusting them than a lazy Trainer and have gorgeous, brilliant colors. By gathering light, Lurantis can fire laser beams using its sickle-like arms. These beams can cleave metal plates. In Generation VII, Solar Blade was its signature move. Lurantis evolves from Fomantis.",70,105,90,80,90,45

Morelull is a small, white Pokémon similar to a mushroom. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pokémon. It has large, black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides. Small bumps ring the top of its head, similar to hair. Its head is much larger than its thin, stem-like body. At the base, the stem splits into three green roots that act as feet. Three large mushrooms sprout from the center of its head. Each mushroom has a thin white stem and a darker ring of color around the base of the cap. The center and largest mushroom is light pink, while the other two mushrooms are smaller and a light purplish-blue. At night, Morelull can make the spores filling its mushroom caps glow. Morelull likes dark, damp areas such as dense jungles, but changes locations every night to avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other Morelull. When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster.. The caps on Morelull's head are a delicacy for Pokémon living in the forests and can grow back overnight. In Generation VII, Strength Sap was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Morelull evolves into Shiinotic.",40,35,55,65,75,15

It has black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides and a thick, black mouth. The ends of its long, thin arms split into three pale green filaments that act as fingers. The lower part of its body and stubby feet are covered in a fluffy pink substance. The mushroom cap on its head has a fluffy pink rim, pale green bumps on top, and a pale green, gilled underside. This Pokémon lives in dark forests and competes with Parasect over territory; their fights often leave the area coated in spores. In the anime, Shiinotic has been shown illuminating the spot and gills on its mushroom. This strange light can confuse people who enter its habitat, causing them to lose their way. Additionally, the flickering spore it releases can cause drowsiness. It takes advantage of sleeping prey by sucking their energy through the tips of its arms. It can also transmit energy to weakened Shiinotic through the same method.

Its body is dark gray with a black head and feet. Along its back and down its tail is an orange-red line. This marking splits into four short lines with round tips at the base of its tail. At the base of its neck are two short, flat spines, which create the impression of a mask or bandanna tied around its head. Its eyes are light purple with slit pupils and there are several tooth-like protrusions along its upper jaw. Each foot has four pointed toes. Salandit is found around volcanoes or arid, rocky environments. From the marking at the base of its tail, it can emit both toxic gas and flames. The gas is created by burning body fluids and has a sweet odor that causes dizziness. However, Bug Pokémon are attracted to the scent and are common prey. The female can also release pheromones that attract males of all species, including humans. Additionally, these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by this Pokémon's will. Because of this, male Salandit offers its food to females, leaving it malnourished and unable to evolve. While it is not a powerful Pokémon, it is able to unbalance opponents with its cunning techniques. It does have difficulty with Spinda, since that Pokémon is already off balance. Prior to Generation IX, Salandit and its evolved form, Salazzle, were the only known Pokémon that could have Corrosion as an Ability. Female Salandit evolve into Salazzle.

Its thin body has a grayish purple underside with several wavy, dark pink markings: a U-shaped marking with two additional lines inside on its chest and one on each hip resembling wisps of smoke. The dark gray on its head and neck extends slightly onto its chest in a V-shape. It has a slender head with purple, almond-shaped eyes with slit pupils and two fang-like projections on each side of its lower jaw. There are two thin, wavy growths on its back at the base of its tail, which is whip-like with a dark pink underside. Its hands and feet each have five long, thin digits, with dark pink palms that can unleash flames. Salazzle is a female-only species with no known male counterpart, as the male Salandit cannot evolve due to malnutrition. Salazzle can be found deep in caves with a reverse harem of male Salandit. Salazzle emits a poisonous gas that contains sweet-smelling pheromones, which attract the males. The gas can also be diluted to make perfumes. Salazzle forces the male Salandit it has attracted to serve it and bring it food and those that are unable to are punished with flaming slaps. Salazzle fight with each other over male Salandit; the winner is the one with the most male Salandit in its harem. As shown by the core series games since Generation VIII, Salazzle normally stands and walks on all fours, standing on its hind legs only in specific moments such as when battling or interacting with its trainer. Illustrations for the Trading Card Game also show its ability to stick to surfaces with its feet, allowing it to walk on all fours even on vertical and upside-down surfaces. In Generation IX, Fire Lash is its signature move. Additionally, prior to Generation IX, Salazzle and its pre-evolved form, Salandit, were the only known Pokémon that could have Corrosion as an Ability.

Its white-tipped ears are situated on the sides of its head, and there is a small, white-tipped tuft of fur under each. Around the center of its short, puffy tail is a dark pink ring marking. Under the tail is a small, white flap resembling the tag on a stuffed toy. This is actually an organ that releases an odor used to communicate with others of its kind. Despite its small size, Stufful has extraordinary strength and can knock out even well-trained Pokémon if they are unprepared. The combination of its cute appearance, mannerisms, and fluffy fur make it very popular. However, Stufful actually dislikes being touched and will flail its powerful arms if it is embraced. Stufful's flailing is powerful enough to break thick tree trunks. Prior to Generation VIII, Stufful and its evolved form, Bewear, were the only known Pokémon that could have Fluffy as an Ability.

The hind paws have three white digital pads on the front. It has a short tail with dark pink rings. While Bewear may appear friendly, it is actually a very dangerous Pokémon — even considered to be the most dangerous Pokémon in Alola. It must never be approached carelessly, even if it is merely swinging its arms around in a friendly fashion, which is used as a warning. It shows affection with a fond embrace, but its hugs have incredible force. Trainers of this Pokémon must teach it how to restrain itself when showing affection. Its hugs are powerful enough to shatter bones and have killed many Trainers. Bewear also uses its arms to subdue its prey before taking it back to its nest. Bewear is capable of using amazing martial arts moves. Bewear is said to have learned them by observing Black Belts training in the woods. In Lental, Bewear are known to hibernate during seasons when food is scarce. Prior to Generation VIII, Bewear and its pre-evolved form, Stufful, were the only known Pokémon that could have Fluffy as an Ability. Bewear evolves from Stufful.",120,125,80,55,60,60
#0761,Bounsweet,Grass,,Leaf, Oblivious,Sweet Veil,Grass,,False,"Bounsweet is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Steenee starting at level 18, which evolves into Tsareena when leveled up while knowing Stomp. Bounsweet is a small Pokémon resembling a mangosteen. Most of its body is pinkish-purple with a short, white bottom around its waist, which resembles the flesh of a mangosteen when it is cut open. It has beady yellow eyes and two tiny legs. On top of its head is a green calyx. This structure consists of four leafy green formations and a short stem. This Pokémon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole or collected by other Pokémon, especially Toucannon and Greedent. It is too sweet for human consumption, but its sweat can be used to make a juice. Bounsweet was highly valued by humans in the past in a time when sweets were rare. While fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward. Bounsweet evolves into Steenee, which evolves into Tsareena.",42,30,38,30,38,32
#0762,Steenee,Grass,,Leaf, Oblivious,Sweet Veil,Grass,,False,"Steenee is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.

The right leaf has two yellowish-green spots on it. The upper part of its torso has short ruffles at the top similar to a dress. Its wide hips are made up of six segments and resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. Its slender arms have slightly rounded hands with no visible digits, and its legs have pointed tips. While it has a delectable fragrance, this Pokémon also has a tomboyish personality that can make it hard to get along with. Steenee's scent is a popular antiperspirants used by humans and helps others feel invigorated. Steenee's peeled rind can be used for stomach pains. Its calyx has hardened, allowing it to play with other Pokémon without worrying about being damaged. However, the leaves spin as Steenee moves and often strike nearby objects. It apparently does not care what it hits, and even uses the calyx as a form of attack. Foes are struck with the leaves first, then kicked by one of Steenee's equally hard legs.. It also uses those legs to protect itself from its natural predator Corvisquire. Steenee has are known to bounce around the forests it lives in. Steenee evolves from Bounsweet and evolves into Tsareena.",52,40,48,40,48,62
#0763,Tsareena,Grass,,Leaf, Queenly,Sweet Veil,Grass,,False,"Tsareena is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Steenee when leveled up while knowing Stomp. It is the final form of Bounsweet. Tsareena is a bipedal, plantlike Pokémon with a humanoid appearance. Its torso, arms, and legs are dark purple, while its hips and head are white. It has heavy-lidded, dark purple eyes with purple eyelids and long purple eyelashes, but has no visible mouth or nose. The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, its legs are long and powerful. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portions of its legs taper into small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments that resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. On top of Tsareena's head is a light green calyx. The shortest leaf of the calyx extends slightly forward and then curves to the right, similar to side-swept bangs. The other three leaves resemble long hair and extend nearly to the ground. The three long leaves each have three yellow spots near the top and three near the bottom; the markings are present on both the under and upper sides of the leaves. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes. Tsareena is known to be both powerful and aggressive. This Pokémon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone who approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however, and instantly calms it down. Tsareena fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts as a distraction. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pokémon uses its power to protect its pre-evolved forms. Quaquaval is Tsareena's rival in kicking. Tsareena is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Trop Kick. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Queenly Majesty as an Ability.

The flowers are white, purple, red, and yellow. Comfey usually holds the last flower in its two short arms. On either side of the main crest is a smaller, pale yellow tuft. Comfey is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. This Pokémon stretches sticky vines from its head to pick flowers to create the ring around itself and will give these rings to those it likes. The flowers can also be thrown at enemy Pokémon to create an opening to either flee or attack. However, it feels uneasy without flowers. Comfey spreads oil from its body along its flower ring. The oil changes the flowers so they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pokémon at hospitals. Each Comfey wears different flowers, which give off its own unique scent and never wither. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Comfey is known to sleep with a smile and a flower close to its face. The flower is said to have a scent that helps it sleep comfortably. Comfey is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Floral Healing.

While most of its body is covered in white fur, its hands, feet, and snout are bare with its light gray skin visible. The fur around its head and under its chin is longer and creates the impression of a long beard. It has a broad, flat nose and a black area around its eyes. Underneath each eye is a yellow ring marking, which is encircled by a light blue ring marking. In the center of its forehead is a yellow marking shaped like a four-pointed star. A cape of purple fur covers its back and is divided into many wavy clumps with strands of orange and light blue throughout. The purple fur grows longer as it ages. Oranguru holds a fan created from green leaves woven together with its own purple fur. This solitary Pokémon spends its time deep in the forest, meditating high up in the trees. While it is not normally active, it will provide food to hungry Pokémon and give medicine to injured ones. It has even been known to use human tools or items, including Poké Balls. It has a lofty attitude and will give other Pokémon orders. This can make them difficult Pokémon for Trainers to handle. Ancient people actually thought Oranguru were people and called them the ""people of the forests."" Oranguru does not get along with others of its kind, often battling out their wits for superiority. It will also occasionally venture to the beach to match wits with Slowking. Oranguru is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Instruct.

It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, but it is considered to be a counterpart of Oranguru. Passimian is a black-and-white Pokémon resembling a powerfully built lemur with broad shoulders. Most of its fur is white, but it has a black muzzle, upper body, hands, feet and ankles, and tail. However, there is a wavy white ring near the tip of its tail. The fur around Passimian's head and face is longer and forms many small clumps, especially around the top of its head and under its chin. On top of its head is a pale green helmet similar to half of a coconut shell. The helmet has a small orange blaze on the front and two leaves that stand up straight attached to the back. Its eyes are partially hidden by its headwear, but its yellow sclerae and reddish-orange irises are visible. It is often seen carrying a large berry that resembles a green coconut. There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most Passimian have green leaves, the anime has shown that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves' color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another. This Pokémon creates troops of 20 to 30 members. Each troop has a leader that picks 10 of the strongest members to search for food. Passimian tend to get into territorial disputes with Ambipom in their search for comfortable trees, in which they win half the time. This Pokémon's battle strategy involves throwing berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling berries. Some Passimian are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive Passimian looks to its Trainer for leadership. If its Trainer has poor form when throwing Poké Balls, it will refuse to obey. Passimian is the only known Pokémon with the Ability Receiver.",100,120,90,40,60,80

It has a long spike on each side of its head that curves backward, large yellow eyes with two short extensions over them like eyelashes, and two flat antennae that extend over its back. There are eight short legs on its underside, and it has a long, prickly tail. This Pokémon is cowardly by nature and wary of both noise and sudden movements. However, its curiosity will cause it to approach people or Pokémon that are standing still. It will spit a poisonous liquid when threatened. Wimpod sometimes accompanies its evolved form, Golisopod. The stench of this fluid warns others that danger is nearby. Wimpod will eat and store anything, including garbage from the sea. This habit makes them highly valued as cleaners. When it finds coins, Murkrow and Meowth go after it. Wimpod is the only known Pokémon that can have Wimp Out as an Ability. Wimpod evolves into Golisopod.",25,35,40,20,30,80

It is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod. Golisopod will do anything to win a fight. When it sees an opening to take advantage of, Golisopod will use the small claws on its front legs to finish off its opponent. Grapploct is the natural predator or prey of Golisopod, depending on who wins the fight. In Generation VII, First Impression was its signature move, but Farfetch'd could still inherit it via breeding. Golisopod is the only known Pokémon that can have Emergency Exit as an Ability.

#0769,Sandygast,Ghost, Ground,Water,,Sand Veil,Amorphous,,False,"Sandygast is a dual-type Ghost/Ground Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Palossand starting at level 42. Sandygast is a Pokémon formed from sand. It is mostly a mound of whitish sand dotted with gray pebbles. A tunnel through its center acts as a mouth, and a small depression above that has two pebbles for eyes. A red shovel with a white handle is stuck blade first into the top of its head. On either side of its main body is a smaller mound reminiscent of a stubby arm. Sandygast is known to inhabit beaches, and is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pokémon that suffer defeat in battle or the deceased. It can suck the life force of people or Pokémon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. Sandygast uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. Sandygast cares a lot about the shovel on its head. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel. Sandygast attacks prey by flinging sand into their eyes; however, because Sandygast is very slow, its prey tend to escape before it can approach them. Sandygast and its evolved form, Palossand, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up. They are also the only known Pokémon that can have Water Compaction as an Ability.

#0770,Palossand,Ghost, Ground,Water,,Sand Veil,Amorphous,,False,"Palossand is a dual-type Ghost/Ground Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Sandygast starting at level 42. Palossand is a Pokémon resembling a yellowish sand castle with gray pebbles along the base. It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top. Palossand has been referred to as the ""Beach Nightmare"". Palossand has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It controls adults to make them build its sand castle body, which provides it a disguise and defense. However, unlike Sandygast, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand enjoys the life force of Pokémon, and creates a sandy vortex to capture small Pokémon before draining their vitality. The bones of Palossand's victims are kept buried beneath it, and traces of its victims' ill will are left wherever it passes. These traces of negative energy are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast. Palossand is able to fire the bones it keeps within from the hollows in its arms. As seen in the anime, Palossand can manipulate its size and grow to the size of a building. Palossand can be found at beaches; however, it hates the water. It cannot maintain its castle-like shape during heavy rain storms. Palossand and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

#0771,Pyukumuku,Water,,Innards,,Unaware,Water 1,,False,"Pyukumuku is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Pyukumuku is a marine Pokémon with an ovoid, black body. Its face has two beady, pink eyes and a white mouth shaped roughly like a star or Daimonji. This Pokémon is capable of spitting its organs out through its mouth. The white organs can take different shapes, such as a fist. Two lines of three pink spikes run down each side of its back. The middle spike of each line is about twice as long as the others are. A fluffy white puff forms its tail. Pyukumuku tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation. Its body is coated with a viscous fluid that allows it to stay on land for a week without drying out. This fluid is also beneficial to people as a moisturizer. If stepped on, it will expel its fist-like organs and smack the perpetrator. It particularly hates having its mouth or spikes touched. Tourists dislike Pyukumuku due to its appearance and lifestyle and often accidentally step on Pyukumuku. This creates a need for part-time jobs on beaches chucking this Pokémon back into the sea. However, people in Alola have already taken to throwing the Pokémon back to the sea where it can find food when thin. Pyukumuku is shown to have a symbiotic relationship with Pelipper, which carries it after scooping it from the water. Pyukumuku is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Purify.

#0772,Type: Null,Normal,,Battle,,,,,True,"Type: Null is a Normal-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves into Silvally when leveled up with high friendship. Type: Null is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pokémon with traits from a variety of creatures. Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders it's agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pokémon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward. A mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes. Type: Null was created by the Aether Foundation as part of the beast killer project. It was designed to be an ""Anti-UB Fighting life-form"", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as ""beast killer"", Type: Null was developed with cells taken from all known Pokémon types. This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory, an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library. This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it ""Type: Full"". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pokémon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to Type: Null. At some point before the events of Generation VII, Gladion was able to free one of the Type: Null, which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally. When Type: Null evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process. In Generation VIII, a new Type: Null surfaces in the Galar region, apparently created by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola. Type: Null evolves into Silvally.",95,95,95,95,95,59
#0773,Silvally,Normal,,RKS,,,,,True,"Silvally is a Normal-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Type: Null when leveled up with high friendship. Silvally's RKS System allows it to change forms and type when it holds a memory. Silvally is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pokémon with traits from a variety of creatures, with an appearance nearly identical to its pre-evolution, Type: Null. It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. Silvally has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive, with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes. Once Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it destroys its control mask and finally evolves into Silvally or Type: Full, as it used to be called. After its evolution, it reactivates its RKS System, gaining the ability to change its typing through the Memories created by the Aether Foundation; this ability was based on the powers of a certain Pokémon depicted in myths. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its Trainer, and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense.Gladion was the one who coined Silvally’s name, but when it was created, it was named as ""Type: Full"" due to its ability to change between all Types. Silvally is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Multi-Attack. Silvally has eighteen different forms, one for each type. Thanks to its RKS System, Silvally is capable of changing its form and type according to the memory attached to it; its eyes, spikes, drives, and fin membrane all change color to match its current type. Silvally evolves from Type: Null.",95,95,95,95,95,95
#0774,Minior,Rock, Flying,Shields,,,Mineral,,False,"Minior is a dual-type Rock/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Minior can change forms during battle, due to its Shields Down Ability, depending on its current HP. When Minior's HP is below half, it changes from Meteor Form to a form where its core is exposed. Exposed core Minior will revert back to Meteor Form if its HP is restored above 50%. Minior's exposed core can be one of seven colors, which are non-interchangeable and correspond to the colors of a rainbow. These forms are Red Core, Orange Core, Yellow Core, Green Core, Blue Core, Indigo Core, and Violet Core. Minior is a spherical Pokémon with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type. In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place. When its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes. Minior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories. While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as Rayquaza. Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, Alola being one of them. Minior is the only known Pokémon that can have Shields Down as an Ability. Minior has two forms: Meteor Form and the seven colored forms for its core that are otherwise identical. All Minior have the same Meteor Form regardless of the color of its exposed core, which can be any of seven colors corresponding to the colors of a rainbow. The color of a Minior's core cannot be changed.",60,60,100,60,100,60
#0775,Komala,Normal,,Comatose,,,Field,,False,"Komala is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Komala is a blue-gray Pokémon similar to a koala. It has large, rounded ears with light orange fur on the inside. Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible. This Pokémon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only Komala can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well. This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pokémon in Alola, appearing to prefer them over humans. Komala is the only known Pokémon that can have Comatose as an Ability.",65,115,65,75,95,65
#0776,Turtonator,Fire, Dragon,Shell,,,Monster, Dragon,False,"Turtonator is a dual-type Fire/Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Turtonator is a bipedal, turtle-like Pokémon with a spiny shell. Its skin is a muted green and only visible on its limbs, tail, head, and neck. On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them. This Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokémon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest. This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils. Turtonator is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Trap.",60,78,135,91,85,36
#0777,Togedemaru,Electric, Steel,Iron, Lightning,Sturdy,Field, Fairy,False,"Togedemaru is a dual-type Electric/Steel Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Togedemaru is a spherical, rodent-like Pokémon. Most of its front is white, while its back is primarily gray. It has black eyes, a short pointed snout with a black nose, rounded ears, and a circular, yellow marking on each cheek. Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated, these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs. When Togedemaru's spines are out, its cheek marks sometimes look like electrical outlets. Togedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as a strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it. When it is pleased, this Pokémon will curl into a ball and roll around uncontrollably. Togedemaru clashes with Elekid whenever it tries to steal the latter's electricity, usually ending with even matches. In Generation VII, Zing Zap was its signature move. A special Togedemaru in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Hokulani Observatory's Island trial.",65,98,63,40,73,96
#0778,Mimikyu,Ghost, Fairy,Disguise,,,Amorphous,,False,"Mimikyu is a dual-type Ghost/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Mimikyu changes forms, from Disguised Form into Busted Form, when it is hit by an attack. Mimikyu is a small Pokémon whose body is almost entirely hidden under an old rag. Its small size makes it one of the shortest Ghost types. Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the anime, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within. A lonely Pokémon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. Mimikyu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Let's Snuggle Forever. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Disguise as an Ability. A special Mimikyu in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Thrifty Megamart 's Island trial. Artwork of Mimikyu's claw and empty rag Silhouette of a Mimikyu's true form swimming in water Mimikyu's eyes seen from under its rag Mimikyu has two forms: Disguised Form and Busted Form. Mimikyu changes into its Busted Form when it is hit by an attack and its neck breaks, causing it to slump over and no longer convincingly resemble a Pikachu. Ordinarily, the rag it wears allows Mimikyu to avoid attacks. Mimikyu will attempt to keep up its disguise, even if its rag is broken. However, if its rag does get damaged or its neck gets broken, it will spend all night patching it in front of a mirror as if its life depends on it. Repairing the rag correctly is often difficult for Mimikyu, so it cries a lot on the inside. It then seeks revenge on the one that damaged it, fearing that its true identity could have been exposed. Unforgiving, Mimikyu will take down the culprit at the risk of costing its own life in the process. Mimikyu will never forget the person who damaged its rag for as long as it is still alive.",55,90,80,50,105,96
#0779,Bruxish,Water, Psychic,Dazzling, Strong,Wonder Skin,Water 2,,False,"Bruxish is a dual-type Water/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Bruxish is a fishlike Pokémon with a thick skin covered in colorful scales and fins. The front of its body is light blue with large, dark purple lips and a mouth full of sharp teeth. The upper half of its body is mostly light purple, while the lower half is mostly yellow. The purple portion of its body is dotted with light blue spots. The yellow underside extends up around its eyes, which are light purple with light blue pupils. Its eyelids are dark purple with long, light blue eyelashes. Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center. This Pokémon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents. When emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokémon from gathering. Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly. Bruxish is the only known Pokémon that can have Dazzling as an Ability. In Generation VII, Psychic Fangs was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.",68,105,70,70,70,92
#0780,Drampa,Normal, Dragon,Berserk, Sap,Cloud Nine,Monster, Dragon,False,"Drampa is a dual-type Normal/Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.

Most of its skin is bluish-green, but the lower half of its face and the underside of its neck is a pale green. There are three spots on each of its sides that are also light green. It has pink eyes with rounded, yellow eyebrows, short whiskers resembling a mustache, floppy ears, and a small, white beard with a circular extension. On top of its head is a mop of white hair split into four rounded sections: two draped down either side of its head. Fluffy white fur drapes the lower half of its body and conceals its arms when they are tucked against its chest. When its arms are spread, two short claws are revealed on each hand. It has a bushy white tail with a small, curved spike at the base. This draconic Pokémon lives alone in the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level. The Berries it feeds on do not grow at this altitude, so it descends to the base of the mountains daily at dawn. It loves communicating with people and Pokémon, and is especially gentle with children. It will often appear in areas where children gather and play with them. Despite its gentle nature, it becomes enraged if a child it cares for is hurt, and can go as far as to burn the bully's house down if able. As seen in the anime, Drampa is capable of flying.",78,60,85,135,91,36
#0781,Dhelmise,Ghost, Grass,Steelworker,,,Mineral,,False,"Dhelmise is a dual-type Ghost/Grass Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Dhelmise is a Pokémon made up of an anchor and a ship's wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is Dhelmise's true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor's thin shank and the spindle of the wheel. Five individual strands of seaweed trail off this small hub in a star shape. The ship's wheel is lavender on the outside with a yellow inner rim. It is affixed to the back of the spindle by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four handles, all of which are yellow. There are two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a yellow ring-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical ring on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it. Dhelmise prefers large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord. The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow. The victim is then enveloped in seaweed, which can be stretched hundreds of yards, and has its life force drained. In addition to hunting, this Pokémon maintains itself by adding new detritus and seaweed to its body. It is known to get along well with Skrelp and Dragalge. Dhelmise is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Anchor Shot. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Steelworker as an Ability.",70,131,100,86,90,40

The lower half of its body is black, while the upper half is light gray. It has a beak-like snout with a small, tooth-like spike in each corner of its lower jaw and big, red eyes. On the front of its head is a large, heart-shaped yellow scale. A small tuft similar to ears or small feathers extends from the back of its head on either side, and there is another small, white tuft on its chest. Six teardrop-shaped, loose-hanging scales form a half ring around its shoulders. These scales are gray with pale yellow along the outside edge. A solid yellow scale of the same shape is on the tip of its tail. Each of its feet has three yellow claws. While Jangmo-o trains diligently and remains humble, it has the pride of a warrior. It employs the scale on its forehead for both attack and defense, so it never shows its back to its foe. Many Trainers take this behavior as proof of this Pokémon's valiant nature. Jangmo-o lives and trains with others of its kind in harsh areas that are far away from other Pokémon and people. The scales on its body make a metallic sound when struck and are used to express emotion, communicate with others of its kind, and intimidate opponents. The sounds made by a group of Jangmo-o are known to be particularly noisy. Jangmo-o evolves into Hakamo-o, which evolves into Kommo-o.",45,55,65,45,45,45

In between its shoulders and on each side of its head is a small, white crest made of feathers. It has three yellow claws on each appendage and a long, tapering tail. This Pokémon has many scale plates on its body as well. There is a yellow one on its forehead, which is oval with a light yellow, heart-shaped stripe across the middle. Two circular scales cover the front of its neck; both are light yellow with darker edges. The tops of its arms are covered by three overlapping scales. The first two arm scales are gray with yellow trim, but the last scale is red with yellow trim and much larger. At the tip of its tail is a small, circular scale. This last scale has a light yellow portion before ending in a darker yellow. This Pokémon leaves its fellows to begin training on its own and can be found wherever there are opponents for it to fight. When it finds an opponent, it dances and clangs its scales together to show its strength. This ferocious dance climaxes with a challenging war cry. Because its scales serve as armor, it overwhelms its opponent with attacks without worrying about its own defense. This battle style causes many of its scales are torn off or broken. Hakamo-o considers its broken armor and bare arms as proof of a well-fought battle and wears them with pride. However, the scale begins growing back immediately and harder and sharper than before. Its scale conduct heat well, so shed ones are often molded into pots and pans. Hakamo-o evolves from Jangmo-o and evolves into Kommo-o.",55,75,90,65,70,65
#0784,Kommo-o,Dragon, Fighting,Bulletproof, Soundproof,Overcoat,Dragon,,False,"Kommo-o is a dual-type Dragon/Fighting pseudo-legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Hakamo-o starting at level 45. It is the final form of Jangmo-o. Kommo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon covered in scaly armor. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges. Kommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray. Kommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pokémon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately. While the anime showed that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking. Kommo-o is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul. Kommo-o is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze. A special Kommo-o in Alola serves as the Totem Pokémon for the Vast Poni Canyon's Island trial. Kommo-o evolves from Hakamo-o and is the final form of Jangmo-o.",75,110,125,100,105,85

The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask. The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster. This Pokémon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious and may come to play or battle with people or Pokémon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It does this by summoning thunderclouds. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place. Due to this, Tapu Koko has been referred to as a malevolent deity should it get provoked. It can move lightning-fast in order to confuse enemies that fight it. Tapu Koko is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Koko and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. Furthermore, in Battling the Beast Within!, it was shown to have the ability to transport others into Ultra Space when working together with another Tapu Koko. Tapu Koko and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Guardian of Alola.",70,115,85,95,75,130

Its thin arms have digitless hands and puffy pink bracelets on each wrist. On top of its head is a mass of dark pink, tentacle-like hair. Two longer strands of hair frame its face. Encasing its dark pink lower body and on top of its head is a shell resembling an insect. Tapu Lele's shell is primarily light pink. The portion on top of its head is conical with a white diamond marking in the center and a white half-diamond marking below that. Both diamond shapes are framed in black. The shell around its lower body mirrors these diamond markings and has an additional half-diamond on the back. On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangles and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis. When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings. The people of Akala Island worship Tapu Lele. This guardian of Akala Island is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. Some consider it to be guilelessly cruel for the way it destroys others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. This has resulted in Tapu Lele being described as an incarnation of nature, the reason being it does not feel remorse for its cruel actions. An old legend says that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but rumors point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. Its strength comes from the energy stored within its shell. If Tapu Lele finds itself at a disadvantage in battle, it will prioritize not outright losing as opposed to trying for a decisive victory. It is said to gain energy from the scent of flowers. Tapu Lele is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Lele and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it. Tapu Bulu's shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the ""bull"" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom. Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the ""bull's"" eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking. This guardian of Ula'ula Island is able to command vegetation to grow and change shape to its will. Despite its fearsome power, it is largely inactive, leading some to consider it a lazy Pokémon. It has a peaceful disposition and does not like to cause unnecessary violence, so it rings the bell on its tail to alert others of its presence. However, it is merciless to those who offend it and it is said to have once repelled thieves from its ruins by swinging trees like clubs. The ruined Tapu Village stands as another example of the guardian's wrath. Tapu Bulu is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Bulu and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the ""eye"" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines. As the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to purify anything it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy. As seen in Run, Heroes, Run!, Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. As stated in Memories in the Mist!, long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again. Tapu Fini is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in the Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Fini and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

A Cosmog played an important role in the anime's Sun and Moon arc. It is associated with the guardian deities. It was hypothesized to be an Ultra Beast. Cosmog is a small Pokémon with a gaseous body similar to a nebula. The gases that make up its body range in color from violet to light blue. The very center of its body is black both in front and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence. Cosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor Mohn's research tells that Cosmog can also open Ultra Wormholes when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to Lusamine, the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast, and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as “The child of the stars” by the people of Alola. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it. Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to teleport away should things get dicey. This Pokémon can also be created by Solgaleo and Lunala. The guardian deities watch and protect Cosmog until it fully evolves and returns to Ultra Space to repeat the cycle.",43,29,31,29,31,37
#0790,Cosmoem,Psychic,,Sturdy,,,,,True,"Cosmoem is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. It evolves from Cosmog starting at level 43 and evolves into either Solgaleo or Lunala starting at level 53 depending on the game it evolves in. In Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, Sword, and Scarlet it evolves into Solgaleo, and in Pokémon Moon, Ultra Moon, Shield, and Violet it evolves into Lunala. Cosmoem is a Pokémon in the shape of a translucent, dark-blue orb with a starscape pattern set in a golden shell-like structure. The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokémon also resembles an eye. When evolving, the Pokémon glows either an orange or a purple color, correlating to Solgaleo and Lunala respectively, gaining traits of either a stylized sun or a stylized moon. Encased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In Pokémon Refresh, it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. Cosmoem's shell is said to be harder than any known material. In the ancient times, it was known as ""The cocoon of the stars"" by the people of Alola. Cosmoem is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pokémon in existence, being tied with Celesteela. Cosmoem's height in the Pokédex is actually measured by its width, rather than its height, as seen in its concept art.",43,29,131,29,131,37

It evolves from Cosmoem when leveled up in Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, Sword, or Scarlet starting at level 53. It is one of Cosmog's final forms, the other being Lunala. Along with Lunala, it was initially shown, without a name or any data, in May 2016, but information on it was officially revealed on June 2, 2016. Solgaleo is the game mascot of Pokémon Sun, appearing on its boxart. Solgaleo, Lunala, and Necrozma are often collectively referred to as the light trio by fans. It is associated with the guardian deities. It is related to the Ultra Beasts. Necrozma fuses with Solgaleo using the N-Solarizer to become Dusk Mane Necrozma. Solgaleo is a large, white Pokémon resembling a lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame Solgaleo's head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw. Each spike separates large tufts of Solgaleo's mane. Solid ridges—red nearest Solgaleo's head and yellow farther away—poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim. When Solgaleo enters its Radiant Sun phase, its third eye appears on its forehead—a light blue symbol similar to a compass rose—and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all other parts of its body except its nose turn bright yellow. It enters this phase during attacks or traveling in Ultra Space. The phase does not appear in the series as of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Solgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun; in ancient times, it was known as ""the beast that devours the sun"". It is said to live in another world and returns there when its third eye activates. Its body is capable of holding a vast amount of energy and glows when active. The intense light it radiates can make nighttime look like midday. Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Along with its counterpart Lunala, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the male evolution of. Solgaleo along with Lunala has the power to create Z-Crystals and restore Necrozma's light, regaining its true form. It can also influence a Rockruff's evolution into Lycanroc's Midday form with solar energy. The residents of Ultra Megalopolis uses Solgaleo as their own Ride Pokémon to travel through Ultra Space. Solgaleo, similar to Lunala, is a being composed of light; due to that, it is constantly hunted down by Necrozma through Ultra Space, so it can try and devour Solgaleo's light to ease its nonstopping pain and regain its original, Ultra form. When taken over by Necrozma, Necrozma's body divides into pieces that connect to Solgaleo's body, possessing it and transforming itself into Dusk Mane Necrozma, as its pieces constantly absorb Solgaleo's light. However, Solgaleo can coexist with Necrozma willingly, regardless of fusion. Solgaleo loves Solgaleo Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. Solgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozma are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash.

Lunala is a large Pokémon resembling a skeletal, legless bat. It has a short snout, dark pink eyes with white centers, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala's head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala's wings have a total of seven ""finger bones"": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four ""bones"" in Lunala's wings are only visible in segments. The skin of Lunala's wings is an iridescent deep blue and a light blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of Lunala's tail is also lined by a yellow crescent with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the rib cage. While Lunala does not have any forms, it can enter its Full Moon phase. When Lunala is in Full Moon phase, its third eye—a light red symbol of an eye—appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the yellow parts on each wing are arranged in a circle with the outermost points of the four-pointed stars disappearing in the transformation. It enters this phase during attacks or traveling in Ultra Space. The phase does not appear in the series as of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Lunala has long been honored as an emissary of the moon. In ancient times, it was known as ""the beast that calls the moon"". This Pokémon constantly absorbs light to convert it into energy and can obscure daylight with darkness. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitter, it resembles a beautiful night sky. Lunala's dark energies also serve to shield it from harm. It is said to live in another world, which it returns to when it opens its third eye. Lunala can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space.

#0793,Nihilego,Rock, Poison,Beast,,,,,False,"Nihilego is a dual-type Rock/Poison Ultra Beast introduced in Generation VII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It is code named UB-01 Symbiont . Nihilego is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. In addition to its shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to its concept art, Nihilego's body is made of various types of glass. Nihilego was the first Ultra Beast to be discovered by Mohn of Aether Foundation. Mohn was the one who coined Nihilego's name. Nihilego live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea. Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct. Wicke from the Aether Foundation describes Nihilego's capabilities as such: Its most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When Nihilego latches on to a host, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Rather it awakens the host’s own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego’s is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. In other words, anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Wicke further claims that Nihilego, like all Ultra Beasts, stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power. As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown!, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people. As shown with Lusamine, Nihilego is capable of physically merging with a host. In this ""merged"" state, the bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. The host's body is visible within the bell with their legs dangling beneath it. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. The toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!, its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows Nihilego forming a barrier with its own mass to prevent its host from undoing the fusion. Nihilego's preys on both human and Pokémon Both Nihilego and Lusamine's bodies look different while fused",109,53,47,127,131,103

It has two red compound eyes with two black, spherical basal joints for its red and black antennae between them. Protruding from under these joints is a long, silver proboscis. It has many bulging muscles that appear to be sacs full of a red fluid with small white bubbles inside. There are three sacs on each arm, two on each leg, two on its chest, and several on its shoulders and down its back. Around its waist are three rings of smaller sacs. The muscles on its chest and some on its arms and waist have thin, grayish lines resembling tendons running across them. It has large, five-fingered hands with red knuckles and four pointed legs. There are several black spikes on its body: a small one on each side of its head, two on each shoulder, one on each elbow, and one on each leg. The portions of its body between its muscles are dark red or black. On its back are two pairs of pale orange wings with slightly darker veins. Buzzwole live in another world named Ultra Jungle. Buzzwole's mouth is said to be harder than a diamond. Buzzole is powerful enough destroy to a dump truck with a single punch. Wicke from the Aether Foundation describes Buzzwole's capabilities as such: Its most distinctive feature is its skill to strengthen itself. Buzzwole is able to absorb energy and then achieve a chemical reaction between the energy it has absorbed and its own body fluids. As a result, Buzzwole’s body swells to an almost explosive extent. Its muscles bulge and are so thick and dense that they are stronger even than steel. Both its Attack and Defense experience a clear leap in power. It also displays a habit of striking a pose each time that it takes any sort of action... It is thought this might serve as a method of communication, but it is not well understood. Wicke further claims that Buzzwole, like all Ultra Beasts, stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power.

Its torso is composed of five thin discs that droop slightly downward. The widest disc makes up its shoulders, the second widest its hips, and the two smallest its chest and waist. There is a gold ovoid inside of the widest disc, where its long, thin neck protrudes from. Its arms and legs are also long and thin with gold joints. Its hands and feet are both composed of two golden claws. Pheromosa has a small, semi-flattened head with a yellow, crown-like structure on top. The two tallest points of the crown point to its long, thin antennae, which are white with small gold balls at the tips. Attached to the back of its head are two structures resembling insect wings. The wings are transparent, curve slightly inward, and reach nearly to the ground. It has narrow, purple eyes with bright blue pupils. Pheromosa live in another world named Ultra Desert. Pheromosa's speed is believed to be fast enough to dodge lightning. It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything as if it interprets the Pokémon world as being unclean somehow. Wicke from the Aether Foundation describes Pheromosa's capabilities as such: This UB can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph in just an instant. This speed is greater than any other living creature that has been discovered to date. But its most distinctive features may in fact be its beauty and its powerful pheromones. Most any creature that squares off against Pheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by the beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight. It is still a subject of research, but it’s thought that Pheromosa may possess some sort of organ able to produce a pheromonal substance previously unknown to science. Wicke further claims that Pheromosa, like all Ultra Beasts, stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power.

Below its head is a mass of black cables for its torso and limbs; there are white bands resembling zip ties throughout its body as well. Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat ""fingers"". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing ""claws"" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug. It is the tallest Electric-type Pokémon. Xurkitree live in another world named Ultra Plant. There, many have been seen unmoving, with their arms and legs stuck to the ground, similar to trees. Xurkitree vary greatly in size, from a little bigger than a human to the size of a mountain. Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. Wicke from the Aether Foundation describes Xurkitree's capabilities as such: Its most distinctive feature is an organ that can generate power. This UB’s bodily makeup is highly reminiscent of electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct electricity with great efficiency. It can discharge as much as a million volts of power at a time. When it begins to run out of power, it stabs its legs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike state as it absorbs electricity from the ground. Wicke further claims that Xurkitree, like all Ultra Beasts, stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power.

The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The ""hat"" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in an X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks. On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit. It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of eight smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers.

Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters. Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pokémon, tying with Cosmoem. Celesteela live in another world named Ultra Crater. Wicke from the Aether Foundation describes Celesteela's capabilities as such: Its most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms. This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it is thought to have sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil. Wicke further claims that Celesteela, like all Ultra Beasts, stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power.

It is related to the Ultra Beasts, but its grouping with them is however unconfirmed. Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pokémon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. The black color is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the brain prism, which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each. Necrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beast, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a ""reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts"" and ""a creature almost like an Ultra Beast"". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pokémon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pokémon. This energy is consumed by Pokémon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pokémon such as Solgaleo and Lunala. Necrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma steals light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a ""pillager of light"" in ancient times. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism. It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis. Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past. Necrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability. Necrozma has three additional forms: Dusk Mane Necrozma, Dawn Wings Necrozma, and Ultra Necrozma. Necrozma can take control of Solgaleo or Lunala by fusing with them, dominating their bodies and eclipsing their minds to assume its Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma forms, respectively. However, Necrozma is also able to coexist with its host willingly, regardless of fusion. Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing their limitless light energy, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow while fused like in their Radiant Sun and Full Moon Phases. In both cases, the host's body is covered in pieces of Necrozma's body, which are arranged like armor, and Necrozma wields powers that exceed its respective host; it's powerful enough to open multiple Ultra Wormholes at once across a large area. When fused to either Solgaleo or Lunala, Necrozma becomes uncontrollably vicious and constantly rampages, treating anything it sees as an enemy and brutally attacking them with either its claws or its lasers, which can cut through anything. Necrozma is capable of fusing with Solgaleo and Lunala without the need for N-Solarizer or N-Lunarizer, supposedly due to both Legendaries radiating the same aura it feeds on. Dusk Mane Necrozma resembles an armored Solgaleo with Necrozma as body armor. Dusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back. The front feet have five black claws attached to them with two V-shaped crystals on top of it while the back foot has only three claws. It has a triangular helmet with a long, thin antenna on each side and Necrozma's brain prism is prominently displayed. Solgaleo's own eyes and nose are visible as bright, blue lights. The host's tail gains three black spikes attached to each other, as well as three spikes under the chin. A structure similar to one of Necrozma's legs extends from its back. Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Solgaleo are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash.",97,107,101,127,89,79
#0801,Magearna,Steel, Fairy,Soul Heart,,,,,False,"Magearna is a dual-type Steel/Fairy Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation VII. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Magearna has a second form colored gold and red, known as Original Color Magearna that, while present in Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, was not made available until the release of Generation VIII's Pokémon HOME. It was leaked in the March issue of CoroCoro released on February 10, 2016, and it was officially revealed on February 14, 2016, making it the first Generation VII Pokémon to be revealed to the public. Magearna is a metallic, bipedal, and artificial Pokémon that is made up primarily of spheres. Its head is a medium-sized sphere with a slight point in the back. Around Magearna's head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims; a tiny nose and mouth; and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top. Magearna's upper body is similar to a Poké Ball: it is divided into two light blue portions by a thick gray band. In the front center of the band is a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown. There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs. Magearna was created by a scientist 500 years ago. The sphere in this Pokémon's chest is known as the Soul-Heart, and the scientist created it by collecting life energy from Pokémon. The Soul-Heart is the true body of Magearna. Due to its ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pokémon. It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pokémon as well. Whenever it is sleeping or sometimes when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Poké Ball. Back when it was invented, Magearna's body was primarily painted gold, though a lighter shade than the highlights and rims that adorn its body. The ears and the top half of its lower body were painted red, matching the coloration of an ordinary Poké Ball. This vivid coloring is a sign that it was a present to royalty. The princess of the land was very pleased with it. Magearna is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Soul-Heart as an Ability. Magearna has a separate form known as Original Color Magearna, which has a red and gold body instead of silver.",80,95,115,130,115,65

In the anime, it is associated with Ho-Oh. Marshadow is a humanoid Pokémon that appears to be made of smoky gray shadows. The area around its face resembles headgear, such as a helmet. On top of the helmet are two curled horns or ears with a wispy horn between them. Its eyes are orange-red with yellow pupils, and above each eye is a yellow, oval marking. Each arm has a small bump on the wrist. Around its neck is a smoky collar, and there is a trail of shadows on each foot. When angered or attacking, such as while using its exclusive Z-Move, Marshadow's fighting spirit will begin to burn, causing it to become Zenith Marshadow. In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow's eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color. Very few people have seen it, so its existence has been the stuff of legends and myths. A cautious Pokémon, Marshadow sinks into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed while it observes its surroundings, much like how Gengar can. While hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and copy their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. It can even learn the ultimate technique of martial arts masters it copies. As seen in the anime, Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares. Marshadow is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief. Marshadow is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.",90,125,80,90,90,125

It is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. Poipole's large head is filled with a glowing, adhesive poison, which it can fire from the needles on its head. While spraying opponents with this venom, it laughs wildly. As seen in the anime, Poipole can also shoot a harmless multicolored substance as a way to paint and even communicate to humans and Pokémon. It's shown to have the habit to stand upside down and spin rapidly as a sign of happiness and excitement. Like all Ultra Beasts, it stores an energy within its body similar to the aura seen around Totem Pokémon. This energy is called Z-Power. In The Shape of Love to Come!, it is revealed that wild Poipole live in large numbers in huge nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel, serving as a queen.",67,73,67,73,67,73

Zeraora was born from an explosion caused by a bolt of lightning striking an erupting volcano. It lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokémon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity. Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws.

Currently, it cannot evolve in other games. Its appearance was first teased during the September Pokémon GO Community Day on September 22, 2018, and it was officially revealed on September 25, 2018. Meltan is a small Pokémon with a silvery body of liquid metal. Its head is hard and resembles a golden hexagonal nut, with a small black sphere floating inside. This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. According to official concept arts, Meltan's liquid body is made of gallium, and it can cry gallium tears. Its arms can stretch to be longer or shorter. Meltan's body can corrode various metals, which it then absorbs and eats. The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye. According to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts found in the same place as the Mystery Box, a mysterious item that attracts Meltan to its location when opened. Professor Willow also states that Meltan is said to be created from small shards when a Melmetal rusts and splits apart. Meltan is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the group to evolve into Melmetal. As seen in the anime, the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. When provoked, it will spin its head, creating a sound that calls others of its own kind. This head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection.

A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire. Melmetal is a Pokémon that has come back to life after 3,000 years. In ancient times, it was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. According to Professor Willow, Melmetal lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms. Melmetal applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pokémon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists. Melmetal is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. When Melmetal reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born.

By bringing the hex nuts on its fists together, it can create gigantic fists for an even bigger punch. Gigantamax Melmetal can release tremendous electric beams from its belly, capable of vaporizing opponents and even an entire hill. The electricity is generated by the flow of liquid metal stored in Gigantamax Melmetal's body. Gigantamax Melmetal is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Meltdown.

The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color. In the anime, it can even restore weakened plant-like Pokémon such as Bellsprout. Grookey's green fur can create energy from the sunlight, similar to how plants use their green leaves to photosynthesize. Grookey is said to be full of boundless curiosity. It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. In Generation IX, Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability.",50,65,50,40,40,65

Thwackey is a bipedal, humanoid monkey Pokémon with a light-green body, and lighter-green markings on its face and chest. Its ears, arms, and tail are dark brown, and its two large eyes are yellow in color. It has dark green bands around its wrists and the stick it holds splits in two after its evolution, which it uses to hold up a tuft of leaves resembling hair on its head. When it removes the sticks, the leaves resemble a mohawk, with a dark green color on the ends. It has several sharp teeth. Thwackey can use its two sticks to create a rhythmic beat. The faster a rhythm Thwackey creates, the more respect it earns from its peers. Often, when it drums out rapid beats in battle, Thwackey will get so caught up in the rhythm that it does not realize its opponent has been knocked out. This action will also cause Thwackey to even ignore its own Trainer’s commands. To further develop its sense of rhythm, it constantly uses it in daily life. It can always feel a beat, and it walks while swaying back and forth to this beat, along with drumming with its sticks. As seen in the anime, Thwackey can groom its friends to cheer them up; this is its way to show friendship and trust. In Generation IX, Thwackey and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability.

It is the final form of Grookey. Rillaboom can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Rillaboom if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Rillaboom was introduced in The Isle of Armor. Rillaboom is a bipedal Pokémon resembling a gorilla. Its body consists mostly of shades of brown: light, tan brown on its forehead, chest, abs, and extremities; dark brown on its nose and triangular ears, as well as under its eyes; and medium, mud-like brown across the rest of its body, including its thick arms and legs. Its mouth, the tip of its nose, and its irises are orange, and its sclerae are white. Each of its upper arms have tan marks resembling bow-ties or butterflies, and it has two, diamond-shaped, tan marks running down its spine. The first, and larger, of the two marks begins around its shoulder blades, and the second, and smaller, mark begins below its rib cage. Rillaboom has a thick bush of green, leaf-like hair on its head, which cascades down its back; on its forehead, a single, vine-like hair, which closely resembles a music note, falls between its eyes and curls at the end, which sits to its nose's left side. On its hips on either side, it has green, belt-like adornments resembling four leaves in a row. Similar adornments with two leaf-like parts sit on its each of its shoulders near the clavicles; these adornments appear to be part of its hair when not attacking. On each of its wrists, Rillaboom has cuffs that resemble leafy crowns, with the peaks of the crown facing its hands. Rillaboom always carries its signature drum with it on its back, and pulls it out when engaged in battle. This bass drum is crafted from a tree stump, with several thick branch stumps protruding from it, which form both the legs of the bass drum as well as mid and high toms. Rillaboom also carries two drumsticks in its cuffs and takes them out to beat its drum. By drumming, Rillaboom can tap into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow the direction of its drumming in battle. In a troop of Rillaboom, the one with the best drumming technique is the leader. This is how Rillaboom who challenged each other for leadership usually settles it through a drum battle. Rillaboom has a kind and calm disposition, valuing harmony within its group. It is very sensitive towards discord that could threaten the group's harmony, so it keeps a strict watch for such actions. Any offenders who drum up discord will be strictly disciplined by Rillaboom until they have learned their lesson. Due to its strong sense of unity, it will ferociously defend its allies from trouble. Rillaboom is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Drum Beating. Additionally, in Generation IX, Rillaboom and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability. Rillaboom has a Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Rillaboom, its upper body fuses with its enlarged tree-stump drum. The stump changes to resemble a full drum kit.

Toxtricity is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Overdrive, as well as the only known Pokémon that can have Punk Rock as an Ability. Toxtricity has three forms: Amped Form, Low Key Form, and Gigantamax Toxtricity. Toxtricity's two forms share the same Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Toxtricity, it has a larger appearance that resembles a combination of its two forms. It walks on all fours, but it is also capable of standing on its hind legs. It has a dark purple body with a dark pink underbelly and dark pink accents on its back, soles, and hind legs. Its spikes and the crescent-shaped body part on its waist turn bright pink, and from its waist grows a tail resembling a transmission tower, and two protrusions that resemble conductor coils. Three red clouds surround its tail. It has four horns on its head, and three large electric frills that run from between its horns down to its back: a yellow one at the center, and two light blue ones flanking it on either side. Its eyes have light blue sclerae and yellow pupils, which extend outside of its sclerae, resembling stars. Its chest has two light blue and four yellow organs protruding. Gigantamax Toxtricity's main weapon is its excessive electric energy, which contains more electricity than a thundercloud. It can store up to one million liters of poison. This poison penetrates Gigantamax Toxtricity's brain and causes it to go berserk, leaking toxic sweat all over its body like acid rain. To attack, Gigantamax Toxtricity uses its stored electricity to create a guitar-shaped mass and slams it down toward opponents. The energy and momentum of this attack are powerful enough to create a giant crater. Gigantamax Toxtricity is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Stun Shock.",75,98,70,114,70,75

Sizzlipede is an insectoid Pokémon with a long, flat body. Its thorax and head are mainly red-orange with dark brown sections across its body and yellow rings on its underside which can get very hot. Two fiery whiskers protrude from its face, and it uses its short stubby legs to move around. Sizzlipede uses its coils to wrap around the prey before using its heated body to cook it. Sizzlipede, much like its evolved form Centiskorch, can generate heat using the flammable gas stored within its body. Once the prey is cooked to well-done, it will voraciously nibble at them piece by piece until the last morsel. Sizzlipede is related to Skorupi, with the two sharing a common ancestor. It is a similar species to Venipede, but often gets into fights with it whenever the two meet. Sizzlipede evolves into Centiskorch.",50,65,45,50,50,45

Centiskorch can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Centiskorch if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Centiskorch is a flat, centipede-like Pokémon. It is red, with circular orange-yellow heat-generating organs on the underside of each section, while its dorsal side, along with its legs and mandible, are a darker shade of red. The head has an orange mark in the shape of an exclamation point on the top, and two bright yellow eyes with triangular red pupils. It has orange-yellow flames coming out of its head and rear, simulating antennae and telson. Centiskorch creates flammable gases by fermenting the food in its body, and then burns these gases through the heat-generating organs along its underside. This results in the overflowing flames on either end of its body, which can reach temperatures of almost 1,500 °F . In the manga, the flames on its head can turn off. Due to its violent and belligerent nature, Centiskorch will attack anything that comes near it. When in battle, Centiskorch will rear up and use its long, hot body to attack, either by slamming its searing belly into opponents like a whip or constricting them with its body. Scolipede is the natural predator or prey of Centiskorch, depending on who wins the territorial fight. Centiskorch has a Gigantamax form. When Gigantamaxed, the number of segments and legs on Centiskorch's body increases, with a total of one hundred legs, allowing Centiskorch to move incredibly fast despite its immense size. The underside of its body turns yellow, with light-yellow concentric circles inside each section of its body. The flames from its head and telson are larger and longer and have a lighter part at the center, similar to a ""X"". There are small diamond shapes that dot the topside of its body periodically. It retains the exclamation point on the top of its head, but its eyes are now red and white, with yellow irises. Three red clouds float above its telson. Its firepower when Gigantamaxed increases, resulting in its internal temperature exceeding 1,800 °F . The heat waves coming off of Gigantamax Centiskorch are hot enough to burn opponents and disturb the air currents to the point of causing storms to form. Gigantamax Centiskorch is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Centiferno. Centiskorch evolves from Sizzlipede.",100,115,65,90,90,65

Sinistea is a Pokémon said to be created when a lonely spirit possesses a cold, leftover cup of tea. It is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. The teacup that Sinistea lives in is a famous piece of antique tableware; seafoam green in color with gold rims and a lacy pattern that resembles a face. However, there are many forgeries in circulation. The swirl pattern on Sinistea's purple body serves as a weakness. Should a Sinistea get stirred, the swirl will disappear and cause it to get dizzy. Sinistea can absorb the life force of anyone who drinks it. While it can wait patiently, most of Sinistea's opportunities end up being short, as it tastes so bad that it is spat out immediately.

Its arms are thin and its hands have three digits, and it has two small legs. Polteageist inhabits a large, white teapot with cracks and holes on it, exposing parts of its body. The teapot has a yellow handle, as well as yellow accents on its cover and bottom. There are light blue swirly patterns surrounding the teapot. Most of the teapots that Polteageist inhabit are forgeries, but occasionally an authentic one is found. The black tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinctly delicious flavor, but can cause strong chills when swallowed, and may also induce indigestion, stomach aches, and even death if drunk in excess. Only a Trainer it trusts is allowed to drink its tea. There are gourmets who drink Polteageist's tea everyday, showing no fear of the side effects. Polteageist attacks by shooting the tea at its enemy's mouth. Polteageist live in hotels and restaurants, disguising themselves as tableware and infecting leftover tea to create more of their own kind. As such, Polteageist is a gender-unknown species. A Polteageist's personality is dependent on the type of tea it possesses; the teapot it lives in doesn't affect it. Despite their similar appearances, Polteageist is not related to Sinistcha. Polteageist is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Teatime. Polteageist has two separate forms: Phony Form and Antique Form. Telling either of these forms apart requires careful inspection; Antique Form Polteageist has a stamp of authenticity on the bottom of its teapot, whereas Phony Form Polteageist lacks it.

The flaps on the side of its head appear to be able to function like limbs. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. The tail protrusion on Hatenna's head constantly senses and captures other creatures' emotions. As such, Hatenna is a reclusive Pokémon, preferring to live in uninhabited areas. It tends to run away as fast as possible when it senses strong emotions, as exposure to it for too long will make Hatenna tired.

It has extremely long, layered, symmetrical hair, far longer than its body is tall; much like a cloak, the hair on its head drapes to the ground and swathes around it to conceal much of its true body, which is adorned by a pink semi-translucent dress that gives it a much taller silhouette, resembling that of a stereotypical sorceress or witch. This hair is colored in a gradient of baby-blue, pale pink, and white from its upper portions downwards. The hair above Hatterene's head is shaped like a wide-brimmed witch's hat with a conical shape serving as the crown of the hat formation. Extending from the pointed end of the hat is a single tentacle that ends in a pink bulb and a consecutive baby-blue bulb that has a trio of sharp claws, which can articulate in a manner similar to fingers, jutting out of it. Hatterene is a female-only species. Hatterene has a solitary and reclusive nature, emitting psychic powers strong enough to cause headaches as a method to deter others from approaching and disturbing it. It has also been observed that it dislikes loud noises, tearing apart perpetrators with the claws on its tentacle as a result. As shown in the anime, Hatterene plays with people's minds and creates illusions, deceiving them for its own pleasure. Due to its long hair obstructing its floating body, Hatterene's main forms of locomotion are levitation and short-distance teleportation. This Pokémon lives in forests with no other living creatures nearby, and as such it is known as the Forest Witch. Hatterene is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Magic Powder. Hatterene has a Gigantamax form. Gigantamax Hatterene has grown to a colossal size. While its physiology remains vastly the same, its black eyes are now blue with white pupils.

This ectoplasm surrounds Cursola's core, which is a white sphere with a face like that of Galarian Corsola, and has an oval-shaped opening with three inward-facing notches where the core is. Two half-circle openings similar to eyes are located above Cursola's core. Together, the three openings resemble a screaming face with a sad or pained expression. On its ectoplasmic body, two small branches below the core serve as its arms and one small branch on its forehead serves as a horn. It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks. Cursola's overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky.

The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. Falinks are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in Route 8, where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. In the anime, the six individual Falinks are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In Pokémon UNITE, it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation. An individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail. The Falinks brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face. Falinks is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move No Retreat.",65,100,100,70,60,75
#0871,Pincurchin,Electric,,Lightning,,Electric Surge,Water 1, Amorphous,False,"Pincurchin is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII. It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Pincurchin is a marine, sea urchin-like Pokémon with a black body. Its face has two yellow eyes with black, triangle-shaped pupils on each of them, and two yellow circular mouthparts. A line of sharp spines runs down its back, along with two other lines of two spines each on the side of its body. Each spine has a grayish tip which glows yellow when electric current runs through it. Pincurchin has five hard teeth, which it uses to feed on seaweed by scraping them off rocks and other surfaces. As its food digests, Pincurchin generates electricity, which it stores in its spines. If one of the spines gets broken off, it will continue to emit electricity for approximately three hours. Pincurchin's yellow mouthparts, in contrast, do not conduct electricity. Pincurchin has a timid and easily frightened disposition and will discharge electricity when startled. This serves well as protection against its natural predator Mareanie. In Generation IX, Zing Zap is its signature move. Additionally, in Generation IX, Pincurchin is the only known Pokémon that can have Electric Surge as an Ability.",48,101,95,91,85,15

Snom is a small, larval Pokémon. Most of its round white body is covered by a translucent shell of icy spikes. Its exposed head features two black eyes and round mouthparts. Four short legs are located underneath its body. Snom anchors itself to branches with frigid thread it extrudes from its mouth to disguise itself as an icicle while sleeping. Snom consumes snow that has piled up on the ground, and prefers soft, fresh snow; it will climb its way up a mountain eating through its snow. Snom's internal organs amplify the cold air from the snow it consumes, which it uses to create the spikes on its back. The more snow it eats, the larger and more impressive the spikes grow. As shown in Pokémon Camp, Snom are known to be voracious eaters, only being satisfied with heaping amounts of food. If it is startled, it will quickly burrow into the snow. Snom and its evolution, Frosmoth, are the only known Pokémon that can have Ice Scales as an Ability. Snom evolves into Frosmoth.",30,25,35,45,30,20

It has a blue jewel between its eyes and two long antennae, which are gray at the tip with trapezoid patterns. These antennae are used to detect air currents. Frosmoth has two large wings which are gray with a white rim; the patterns on its wings are the same as that on the tip of its antennae. Frosmoth typically keeps its arms crossed, and its usually obscured, light blue palms each have a heart-shaped pad. The ice scales from Frosmoth's wings can fall like snow while it flies over the fields and mountains. The wings have a temperature of −290 °F . Should anyone desecrate the fields and mountains, Frosmoth will show no mercy. Frosmoth flies around using its icy wings to create blizzards in order to chase away offenders.

It has two large, gray legs resembling the standing stones on Turffield, each of which weighs over 400 pounds . These legs are brown on the lower half, and have gray crosses. In the TCG, a resting Stonjourner is shown to be able to detach and rotate its legs. Occasionally, Stonjourner will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it stands in a field watching the sun's progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, groups of Stonjourner gather from all over to form an evenly spaced ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories involving the position of the sun, the earth's energy, and other factors. Another curiosity is that the elemental composition of the rocks that form Stonjourner's body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from its native habitat. Stonjourner primarily makes its home in grasslands. Stonjourner is the only known Pokémon that can have Power Spot as an Ability.",100,125,135,20,20,70

Females have downward-turned spiral horns, pink markings above their eyes, a white body, and darker legs. These markings all give them the appearance of butlers and maids. These Pokémon willingly serve people and other Pokémon, as they derive energy from feelings of gratitude. They sense emotions by touching their horns to determine other's needs and serve them better. Males are skilled at being valets while the females are supposed to be excellent babysitters. Indeedee is always bustling around, searching and serving those with happy feelings. The Indeedee never leaves its Trainer's side. It uses its psychic power to predict its Trainer's actions and take care of everyday needs.

#0877,Morpeko,Electric, Dark,Hunger,,,Field, Fairy,False,"Morpeko is a dual-type Electric/Dark Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Morpeko can change forms with its Hunger Switch Ability. Its form also changes the type of its signature move, Aura Wheel. Morpeko is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon who can change forms via its signature Hunger Switch Ability, which alters its appearance. The features shared between the two forms are short, stubby arms and feet; a pair of pink circular cheek pouches; a very tiny nose; two almond-shaped ears with a single fur tuft under each; and a primary body color separating two areas of fur which cover the arms, ears, cheeks, and eyes, and zigzag inward towards its face, stopping at the waistline. These fur patches form pockets that it can store seeds in. On the back of its body is a pattern resembling a Pikachu's tail that extends from the bottom half of its fur. In its Full Belly Mode, its body is a creamy yellow, and its eyes are circular and black with large white pupils. The fur on the left side of its body is black, and on the right side, it is brown. A single bucktooth can be seen protruding from its smiling mouth. While in its Hangry Mode, Morpeko's primary body color turns purple, its eyes become downward-slanting red semi-circles, and its right-hand patch of fur turns from brown to black so that it matches the other side. Its mouth is also constantly formed into an angry snarl. Morpeko carries around Berry seeds that have been electrically roasted in its pockets. It treats the seeds with care as if they were precious treasures until it eats them as a snack. The seeds it stores keep Morpeko's hunger at bay due to its small stomach. Unless Morpeko continues to eat its stored seeds, it will become instantly hungry. Morpeko generates electricity with its cheek sacs; this process consumes a lot of energy and causes it to become hungry no matter how much it eats. By experiencing prolonged hunger, the hormones in Morpeko shift in balance, and its fur color changes. As a result of intense hunger, Morpeko becomes aggressive, driven into committing all kinds of evil deeds and enacting extreme violence until their hunger is satisfied. The energy within its cheeks also changes from Electric-type to Dark-type. Hangry Mode Morpeko has a wild, brute-like nature while in this form. However, as seen in the anime, once Morpeko is fully fed, it will refuse to eat more food and attack anyone who tries to feed it.

It has enough physical strength to pull an airplane, and its trunk is strong enough to crush boulders into powder. It lives in social herds and has a boastful disposition; the more vibrant its skin is, the prouder it will be. Copperajah has a Gigantamax form. When it Gigantamaxes, Copperajah's trunk enlarges, its body becomes block-like, and it adopts a bipedal posture, standing on its large hind feet. Its rectangular tusks angle upward and the raised bumps on its trunk extend into overlapping, serrated ridges. Clouds of Dynamax energy float above its head. While Gigantamaxed, Copperajah's trunk is powerful enough to level mountains and obliterate large structures.

Eternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and two young humans. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pokémon Masters EX, Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokémon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokémon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect. As depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Sword and Shield: ""From Here to Eternatus!"", Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokémon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. Pokémon the Series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokémon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokémon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pokémon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In Pokémon Journeys: The Series, Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the Darkest Day, as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago. As seen in chapter PASS30 of the Pokémon Adventures manga, Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in PASS38, both met during the first Darkest Day. Eternatus is an extraterrestrial Pokémon that came to the Pokémon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a cavern called the Max Lair. Eternatus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam. When Eternatus absorbs all the energy in the Galar region, it transforms into its Eternamax form. Eternamax Eternatus is Eternatus's original form. This form's larger size makes it the tallest known Pokémon in existence. Its sheer size dwarfs even Gigantamax Pokémon. Eternatus briefly assumes this form when using Eternabeam, one of its signature moves. In this form, Eternatus's shape drastically changes. Its body becomes incredibly long and serpentine with most of its body forming a massive coil. Its entire body glows red, and at regular intervals across its length are black rings with spikes extending outward. Its back tendrils now curl around its main body. Its energy core rests at the center of the coil inside a cage of violet spikes. Eternatus's head takes on the form of a giant hand, with its ""fingers"" covered in black armor with spikes extending from the back of each segment. At the tip of each finger is a mouth with a glowing pink tongue. In its Eternamax form, Eternatus's power grows so immense that it causes a great storm of Dynamax energy around it, ripping holes in spacetime amid the storm as it releases a virtually infinite amount of energy. In this form, Eternatus is capable of using its most powerful attack, shooting a large beam from the white spot in its ""palm"" and several smaller ones from its ""fingers"" or from all over its immense body. Thanks to a mysterious power, Eternatus can prevent opposing Pokémon from using any moves as it stores its energy. This power however can be countered by both Zacian and Zamazenta in their Crowned forms.",140,85,95,145,95,130

Zarude's vines can also rapidly heal wounds when wrapped around them, and absorb energy from trees. While resting, only the tips of the vines at Zarude's neck and feet extend beyond its skin. However, the vines extending from Zarude's wrists are typically wrapped around its forearms in four concentric rings. Occasionally, Zarude's vines tear off and become nutrients for the soil of the forests it lives in. As shown in the anime, the number of vines can vary, and may indicate a Zarude's age or importance, with Zarude possessing the most vines being the oldest or most dominant. Zarude are social and live in troops. They're usually incredibly aggressive, and frighten most other Pokémon. They attack anyone that aren't part of their pack; they excel in battle with their sharp claws and quick wit. Zarude is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Jungle Healing. A special Zarude named Dada Zarude acts as a unique form. While Zarude are usually aggressive and territorial, they occasionally exhibit a softer side.

Squawkabilly is an avian Pokémon resembling a parrot, with a large rounded yellow beak and lazy eyes. It has tan legs with feet shaped in a zygodactyl arrangement; i.e. two toes each on the front and back. Each toe is tipped with a yellow claw. Squawkabilly has a rounded, lumpy black crest on its head that resembles a pompadour, and white feathers on its eyelids, face, belly, and the tips of its wings. The rest of its feathers have different colorations depending on the form, which come in green, blue, yellow, and off-white. The feathers around the bottom of its body are notably longer, giving the appearance of a longcoat. Squawkabilly are known to be exceptionally noisy. They have a strong sense of community and dislike being alone, so they cooperate and form flocks that can contain more than fifty individuals based on the color of their feathers. In the mornings and evenings, they search for food in forests, towns, and cities; the latter is their preferred habitat, where they fight with other Squawkabilly of different plumes over territory. Green Plumage Squawkabilly make up the largest, most powerful groups, and are viewed by their Blue Plumage counterparts as rivals. Yellow Plumage Squawkabilly are especially fierce, engaging in vicious close combat and driving other bird Pokémon out of towns. White Plumage Squawkabilly have the fewest population numbers, although they are still able to hold territory because their feathers help them camouflage against the white buildings of cities. Squawkabilly once had violent territorial disputes with Fletchling, who inhabit the same rural and urban areas. In Paldea, Squawkabilly is used for the region's Flying Taxi service. Certain Squawkabilly, such as the one found in Medali in the core series games, and Diana's in the anime, are shown to be capable of mimicking human speech. Squawkabilly has four separate forms: Green Plumage, Blue Plumage, Yellow Plumage, and White Plumage.",82,96,51,45,51,92

Its cubic head is white with a few cracks and two eyes in the shape of right angles. Each of the eyes are orange in color with yellow squares at their centers, and they can glow an orange-red. The head is connected to Naclstack's body; the upper half of the body consists of a brown cuboid stone at the front and a rugged, dark brown rock dotted with salt at the back, while the lower body is a single white cuboid. Naclstack's body doesn't connect to its legs and floats in place relative to them. The legs themselves are cube-shaped, with light brown on top and white at the bottom. Each of the cubes have a small brown stone on one of their corners, which seem to act as claws for the Pokémon. Naclstack attacks by pressing the rock salt inside its body into hardened pellets, which it then shoots out with enough force to puncture an iron sheet. Naclstack also uses its salt to dry out and cure its prey. Naclstack leaves behind bits of salt on its footprints as it walks; these salt grains are gathered by people and used as seasoning for sandwiches.

These blades can grow into great swords in battle, increasing Ceruledge's power in the process. Ceruledge is merciless and will do anything to win a battle. It prefers to do close-quarters combat, with a mix of sneak and surprise attacks. By using its quick speed to locate a foe's blind spots, it will then move closer before slashing them with its large swords. Any cuts from Ceruledge's swords will cause wounds that leak life energy, which the swords then absorb. Ceruledge is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Bitter Blade.

Bellibolt's gray belly is covered with a semi-transparent membrane and has a yellow organ inside that resembles a navel, referred to as its belly-button dynamo. As Bellibolt's body expands and contracts, this organ generates electricity, which Bellibolt discharges through the bumps on its head. These head bumps glow when discharging electricity, and they also allow Bellibolt to appear more intimidating. Bellibolt is capable of moving very quickly, but usually chooses to act sluggishly. It is difficult to train Bellibolt to initiate a battle because it has an easygoing temperament, and does not notice its opponents until it is attacked. At night, Bellibolt's stomach emits a strange noise, which signals that it is hungry. Bellibolt is seldom found in the wild, but may rarely be seen alongside riverbanks.

Droopy Form Tatsugiri is mostly a pinkish-red, with white colorations on its belly and fins; true to its name, it tends to droop on its throat sac. Stretchy Form Tatsugiri is a solid yellow, except for its white throat sac; it assumes a straight, horizontal pose. It is said that Tatsugiri's various forms are an adaptation to suit the preferences of its prey. Although relatively weak, Tatsugiri is one of the most intelligent dragon Pokémon. It baits prey such as bird Pokémon by playing dead. When its prey approaches, Tatsugiri then commands its partner, Dondozo, to attack.

Its short, stubby limbs have three digits each, and it has a long, thin, yellow quill on the backs of each of its hands. Frigibax has a triangular dorsal fin located atop a large, whitish circular pattern on its back. This fin absorbs heat, which Frigibax converts into ice energy. Frigibax stores the ice energy inside its body and uses it to cool its dwelling. It stores more ice energy the greater its surrounding temperatures are. Frigibax lives in forests and rough terrains, and fights with Bergmite whenever they meet. Frigibax and its evolutions are the only known Pokémon that can have Thermal Exchange as an Ability.

After the evolution, the Gimmighoul Coins disappear. Gimmighoul's evolution cannot be canceled with the B button. Gimmighoul has two separate forms: Chest Form and Roaming Form. Only Chest Form Gimmighoul can be battled and caught, while Roaming Form Gimmighoul will flee when interacted with, leaving behind Gimmighoul Coins. Roaming Form can only be obtained by transferring it from Pokémon GO via the GO Transporter. Gimmighoul is a small, blue-gray, metallic, bipedal Pokémon, with bands of two thin black stripes present around its torso and between its gold, circular eyes. It has a pair of thin black antennae and a tail, which are bent near the base and tipped with small gold circles. These antennae vibrate when detecting something it deems notable. In its Chest Form, Gimmighoul hides inside a red chest, decorated with black and golden accents and a silver buckle with an ornate oval pattern, resembling the number 1,000 when viewed from the side. The chest it resides in is full of Gimmighoul Coins. In its Roaming Form, Gimmighoul carries one of these coins on its back. Both forms of Gimmighoul have different personalities. Gimmighoul was first discovered and named by Jacq and Professor Willow. In its Chest Form, Gimmighoul's treasure chest provides defense but makes it hard for it to move due to its weight. Its disguise and low movement speed cause it to be commonly mistaken for an antique and get left behind or taken away. When Chest Form Gimmighoul senses an approaching person or Pokémon, it will use ghost energy to possess its target and force them to collect Gimmighoul Coins. It tends to hide in less frequented places such as warehouses and shop corners to ambush people and Pokémon, and its control has notable persistence; one old tale tells of a Gimmighoul who manipulated a young girl to gather 999 coins to fill its chest. It is also known to drain the life out of anyone who attempts to steal its coins. When Gimmighoul has gathered 999 of the coins, it is able to evolve into Gholdengo. Chest Form Gimmighoul was said to have been born inside its chest 1,500 years ago. Chest Form Gimmighoul can live in a variety of different areas in Paldea, such as ancient ruins, watchtowers, and secluded islands in the Paldean Sea. Roaming Form Gimmighoul is among the smallest and lightest of all Pokémon, and is created from coins infused with passion. In its Roaming Form, Gimmighoul is extremely timid, running away and dropping its coin as soon as anyone approaches. It does not manipulate people and Pokémon to give it coins like its Chest Form counterpart; instead, it is able to gather coins by itself. Despite being found everywhere in Paldea, no one has apparently been able to capture Roaming Form Gimmighoul. It constantly wanders, believed to be searching for the chest it used to live in. For sustenance, it drains the life force of humans who try to steal its coin. This form of Gimmighoul has also been seen appearing in the world of Pokémon GO, where it tags along near Trainers who pick up Gimmighoul Coins. Gimmighoul has also been observed being lured over through the Coin Bag and Golden Lure Modules. Gimmighoul has two separate forms: Chest Form and Roaming Form.

It is capricious and curious enough to sometimes play with humans, despite usually being cautious of them. While fighting in its Apex Build, Koraidon dominates its opponents using its immense strength and the many natural weapons available to it, including its tough jaws and fangs, sharp claws, and thick, powerful tail.

When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the blue and yellow energy on its throat, tail and antennae to turn turn silver, similar to what happens in its Low-Power Mode.

It evolves from Applin when exposed to a Syrupy Apple and evolves into Hydrapple when leveled up while knowing Dragon Cheer. It is one of Applin's three branched evolutions, the others being Flapple and Appletun. Dipplin is a worm-like Pokémon that lives inside an apple. In contrast to Applin's other evolutions, Dipplin bears a strong resemblance to Applin. Unlike Applin, however, Dipplin appears to be composed of a pair of separate creatures known as ""wyrms""; the head and tail visible outside of Dipplin's apple appear to belong to two different ones. The head belongs to the ""fore-wyrm"" while the tail belongs to the ""core-wyrm"". Both of Dipplin's bodies are light green, with a yellow-green underside. The fore-wyrm's head has two large yellow leaf-like eyestalks with small black pupils, and a tall, thin protrusion similar to a horn or an antenna. The core-wyrm's tail that sticks out from Dipplin's rear has two leaf-like features on it. Dipplin's evolution is said to have been triggered by the Syrupy Apple, found exclusively in Kitakami.

This syrup has a fragrant scent that captivates Dipplin's opponents. They can use the syrup to engulf their opponents and hinder them. Dipplin and its evolved form, Hydrapple, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Syrup Bomb and the only known Pokémon that can have Supersweet Syrup as an Ability.

#1012,Poltchageist,Grass, Ghost,Hospitality,,Heatproof,Mineral, Amorphous,False,"Poltchageist is a dual-type Grass/Ghost Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Teal Mask expansion. It evolves into Sinistcha when exposed to an Unremarkable Teacup or a Masterpiece Teacup, depending on Poltchageist's form. It is ecologically similar to Sinistea; however, the two are separate species. Poltchageist is a Pokémon made of matcha tea powder that inhabits a tea caddy; specifically a 茶入 chaire, a kind used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The tea caddy is primarily black and white, with a white lid, a sealed crack near the top, and a painted pattern resembling a face. Poltchageist is always seen carrying a 茶杓 chashaku, the tea scoop used to transfer tea powder into the tea bowl in the aforementioned tea ceremony. Poltchageist heavily resembles Sinistea, although they are not biologically related. On top of its matcha body, just below its lid, is a yellow swirl pattern similar to the one found on Sinistea. On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for Poltchageist. According to an old tale, Poltchageist was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him. Poltchageist is more active at night than during the day, prowling around towns and their outskirts. By day, Poltchageist dwells in cool, dark places — usually in old houses, which is its favorite. Poltchageist tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for Poltchageist to use as energy. It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once. Another behavior exhibited by Poltchageist is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder. Poltchageist and its evolved form, Sinistcha, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability. Poltchageist has two separate forms: Counterfeit Form and Artisan Form. Telling either of these forms apart requires careful inspection; an Artisan Form Poltchageist bears a stamp of authenticity on the base of its caddy, while a Counterfeit Form Poltchageist lacks it.

It evolves from Poltchageist when exposed to an Unremarkable Teacup or a Masterpiece Teacup, depending on Poltchageist's form. Sinistcha's form is determined by the form it was as a Poltchageist. It is ecologically similar to Polteageist; however, the two are separate species. Sinistcha is a Pokémon made of matcha tea. As such, its main body is entirely green, except for its mouth and swirly eyes, which are yellow in color. Its arms are thin and its hands have three digits, and it has two small legs. It inhabits a 茶碗 chawan, a tea bowl used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The chawan it inhabits is black and white, with a few cracks sealed with green all over it, and a swirling, face-like pattern on its side. Atop its head, Sinistcha wears a 茶筅 chasen , which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, Sinistcha is not biologically related to Polteageist. Sinistcha lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, Sinistcha would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force. However, because the chawan Sinistcha inhabits had fallen out of use, this act became largely unsuccessful. In recent times, instead of sneaking into houses, Sinistcha roams towns and suburbs in search of prey. It is generally active after sunset, and will attack anything that approaches it with a life-force-draining splash of tea. In order to prepare itself for battle, Sinistcha builds up its energy by using the chasen on its head to stir itself. Sinistcha is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Matcha Gotcha. Additionally, Sinistcha and its pre-evolved form, Poltchageist, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability. Sinistcha has two separate forms: Unremarkable Form and Masterpiece Form. Telling either of these forms apart requires careful inspection; a Masterpiece Form Sinistcha bears a stamp of authenticity on the base of its chawan, while an Unremarkable Form Sinistcha lacks it.

It evolves from Duraludon when exposed to a Metal Alloy. Archaludon is a tall, metallic, bipedal dinosaur-like Pokémon with an angular, cuboid body bent at its chest and hips. Its body is primarily cool gray, although it has dark blue colorations on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past Archaludon's head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of Archaludon's spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail. Archaludon's head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth. Archaludon's hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, Archaludon has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from Archaludon's surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own. Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on Archaludon's head and tail. When Archaludon faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy. When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster. Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. Archaludon often digs holes in the mountains while searching for food. Archaludon and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon, are the only known Pokémon that can have Stalwart as an Ability. Additionally, Archaludon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electro Shot. Archaludon charging up an attack in its mouth. Archaludon assuming the shape of a bridge and charging up.

Each syrpent has green, leaf-shaped eyestalks with yellow eyes; a long green body with a pale yellow underbelly; and a tail tipped with leafy green ornaments. Three of the seven syrpents are always visible outside of the syrup apple: the dominant syrpent's head rises from the center of the apple, and two of the syrpents' tails emerge from its rear. The central, dominant syrpent has the longest body and is further distinguished by its two horns. The left horn has an apple impaled on it. The four other syrpents composing Hydrapple are usually hidden within the syrup, with only the tops of their closed eyestalks visible from without. Sometimes, the four hidden syrpents emerge from the syrup so that five of Hydrapple's heads are visible. The syrpents that form Hydrapple have inconstant and fickle temperaments. Due to this, the seven syrpents rarely work together as a team. This also prevents Hydrapple from unleashing both full potential and full power. On the rare occasion that the syrpents' moods align, Hydrapple reaches its full potential.

#1024,Terapagos,Normal,,Tera,,,,,True,"Terapagos is a Normal-type Legendary Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Indigo Disk expansion. While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Terapagos has three forms: its Normal Form, its Terastal Form, and a unique Stellar-type Terastallized state referred to as its Stellar Form. When it enters a battle, it changes from its Normal Form into its Terastal Form through its Tera Shift Ability, and transforms from its Terastal Form into its Stellar Form upon Terastallizing. Terastal Form Terapagos is the game mascot of The Indigo Disk, appearing in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero. Terapagos plays an important role in Pokémon Horizons: The Series. In its Normal Form, Terapagos is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan star and ring rub, its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. lastly, it has a ""ponytail"" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them. Normal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokémon, but it is capable of assuming a dormant state when it needs to slumber or when its life is in danger, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel. It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield around itself when necessary, even in its dormant state. As depicted in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, Terapagos is shown to be unable to move if it's turned upside down. This species is seemingly able to live for millions of years while slumbering within its crystal shell. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one Terapagos managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day. According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Terapagos stays in its Normal Form while not battling. Heath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name. Professor SadaS/Professor TuroV did research on this Pokémon while in Area Zero. Terapagos appears to naturally cause glowing crystals to form around it as it slumbers thanks to its ability to transform its own energy into hard crystals, which gave Area Zero the distinctive appearance it possesses. For a long time, many thought Terapagos was fake and that Heath had made it up, but Briar proved its existence by writing her own book: ""The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero"", which details the expedition she, Carmine, Kieran, and the player had in Area Zero Underdepths. The Area Zero journals and the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV imply that Terapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon, which is ultimately confirmed to be the case in the Pokédex. With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with countless star-shaped projectiles. Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in both games and Pokémon Horizons: The Series, it is capable of bringing humans, Pokémon, and objects either from other points in the Pokémon world's timeline or from other timelines altogether to the point in time and space it currently is. When using its timeline-altering powers, a pink mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. The true limits of this power are currently unknown, but seems to affect humans and objects differently, as the player was able to keep the copy of the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV owned by the professor after the encounter at Kitakami's Crystal Pool. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI copy, and the ""time machine"", to exist in spite of human limitations. It is also implied to be responsible for the growth of Herba Mystica, special herbs that can heal or even make Pokémon grow larger. Terapagos can give a Tera Orb the ability to Terastallize Pokémon with no charging drawbacks. Terapagos is also the source of the Stellar Tera Type, a unique Tera Type that contains the powers of each and every type. It could only be found in Area Zero Underdepths, where Terapagos slumbers, however, Briar used crystals growing there on Blueberry Academy's Terarium core so it appears in the academy's Terarium as well. Unlike other Pokémon, it will always receive the full benefits of the Stellar Tera Type, even outside of Tera Raid Battles. Terapagos is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm. Its Normal Form is also the only known Pokémon that can have Tera Shift as an Ability. Its Tera Type is fixed as Stellar and cannot be changed at the Treasure Eatery.",90,65,85,65,85,60
#1025,Pecharunt,Poison, Ghost,Poison,,,,,False,"Pecharunt is a dual-type Poison/Ghost Mythical Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Indigo Disk expansion . It is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It is the leader of the Loyal Three, and is associated with Ogerpon. Pecharunt is a small Pokémon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell. According to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet. It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. If mortally wounded, Pecharunt will retreat into its shell and remain asleep for years so it can regain its strength. After being knocked out in Kitakami, it started being known as the ""Never-Rotting Peach"" due to its peach-like shell. Pecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokémon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, respectively. It serves its mochi to Pokémon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. According to Penny, the mochi that Pecharunt creates are somewhat sweet. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to Pecharunt's will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's friends from Paldea. Humans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. The controlled humans also hold their arms while performing a chicken dance-like movement, repeating the word ""mochi"" constantly. However, in some cases, like with Hideko, it is shown that the possessed human can still speak somewhat freely, though it may simply be Pecharunt influencing the propagation of the mochi among humans. Humans under its influence are often still prone to innate emotion and desires — Arven is visibly embarrassed while dancing, Penny instinctively combines the word ""mochi"" with ""Veevee"", and Nemona still expresses a strong urge to battle, being able to morph ""mochi"" into ""match"". It can even command humans, and Pokémon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling multiple creatures at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is has no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. The effect of Pecharunt's mochi on people are likened by Kieran to a curse. According to myth, Pecharunt came from a distant land where it was adopted by an elderly couple with no children. Pecharunt fed its adoptive parents Binding Mochi to secure their affection, which brought out their inner greed. They made many requests of Pecharunt, who gave them what they requested to be showered with further attention. The couple eventually asked for a brilliant set of masks, which could only be found in Kitakami. Pecharunt left to obtain the masks, recruiting Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti to aid in its quest. They successfully stole three masks from Ogerpon, who defeated and slayed the Loyal Three in retaliation; Pecharunt only survived by going dormant within its shell. It would not surface found again until hundreds of years later when a Mythical Pecha Berry awoke it. Pecharunt is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability.
